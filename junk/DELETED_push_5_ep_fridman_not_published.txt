It's a cloud-based platform for content management, file sharing and collaboration for businesses. But the thing in particular I would like to talk about is how they're using ai. Their Box AI is an industry leading content management platform. They do an incredible job of taking a large number of unstructured documents, so think like contracts, like legal documents, invoices, financial documents, resumes and so on. Take all of that and be able to query it and automate workflows with those documents and build agents on top of those documents. Box in general has a long track record of working with businesses and organizing large amounts of documents, and now building on that track record, they're using AI to manage and organize those documents in a way that's makes them accessible. And you could do all kinds of extractions, ask questions, derive insights, and obviously do all of that in a secure way, in a compliant way. And it is why over 115,000 Enterprises Trust Box. If you want to help scale AI across your organization, go today to box.com/ai. That's box.com/ai to learn more."

I have so many of them. I think they're self-replicating at this point. They're having children on top of each other. I really don't know why have that many is just purely out of love. I have never had a negative experience with anything related to uplift. This is long, long, long before they were a sponsor. I can't frankly believe they're a sponsor. Go buy all of their stuff. They create obviously incredible standing desks. There's a bunch of other stuff, you know, chairs and all kinds of ergonomic solutions, but really the variety, the qualities all there. It's also in Austin, my main desk for basic computer work. It's my main desk for robotics work. It's my main desk for everything. Go to UPLIFT desk dot com slash LEX.

And boy, it's a torturous journey as everybody that goes through the ideation process in any kind of context, whether it's in writing and design and programming, all of that. It's a difficult and painful process. It's full of procrastination, all the different human blockers, the Stephen Pressfield's War of Arts excellent book writes about. And a lot of times it really is about having the right tools to make sure when the ideas come from wherever it is in the ethereal realm, that the ideas do come from, that they have the right kinda workflows and mechanisms to pour out of your mind and out of your soul, and to do so in a collaborative way, in a collaborative environment. So Miro is an incredible tool for doing just that. All kinds of ways of doing ideation together, sticky nose, screenshots, diagrams, prototypes, all of that you can create, you can share, you can collaborate on. It makes the whole process fun, help your teams get great things done with Miro. Go to Miro dot com and find out how. That's MIRO do com."

So this isn't just about generating code in a specific narrow context. It's about deploying a fully tested digital business, and they very much focus on generating stuff that works, which is not AAL thing. When you are generating the full stack, they're calling it the Lindy Build, which goes from the original idea to the working app end to end. I mean, this is a really difficult problem to solve and an impactful one.

I was able to do it at lexier.com/store to sell a few shirts. I should probably add more shirts 'cause shirts are cool. I'm currently, as I record this, I'm wearing a super cool Pink Floyd shirt.

World. And it's too short life trying to figure it all out. Working on human robot interaction with human noise and quadrupeds, enjoying life, enjoying the brief escape to the realm of ideas, to the realm of math and rigor and code into the process of exploring the unknown. It is the thing that makes me truly happy. It is one of the things that makes me happy. And one of the things that makes me happy and healthy is making sure I get enough electrolytes, given that I'm still doing one meal a day, given all the crazy fasting I do and the physical exercise and the mental toll of working crazy hours and sometimes not getting enough sleep, all of that, I just feel better when I get the electrolytes in.

And now, dear friends, here's Dan. You've helped create some of the most incredible characters stories in open worlds and video game history, but when you grew up in the late seventies and eighties, Open world video games wasn't a thing. So you've credited literature and film as early inspiration. So let's talk about film first if we can. Sure. What are some of the candidates for the Greatest films of all time? Maybe films that were highly influential on you. I mean, godfather, God."

So I think, and the bit at Ellis Island is just one of the best shots in all of cinema. When you see little Veto turning up in Ellis Island and you get that shot, it's amazing.

As I think as we moved from the seventies into the eighties, into the nineties, people had seen so many films, they just started to edit films faster and people understood cinematic storytelling so much that you could do things much quicker. You could show a look and just that meant you realize that person was gonna betray the other person. They just edited films much quicker. But I quite like the slowness. I think these days with, with modern, you know, high quality televisions, you have to necessarily watch these films in one sitting, particularly when you're rewatching them.

And on the one hand you see the Robert De Niro character, he's still good at making money. So they let him return to normal life. But then you get that brilliant scene when all of the, the mob bosses from back home, they're discussing all these people who, who, who may or may not be able to implicate them. And then there's that incredibly cold line. And one of them, they're thinking about the, the old, you know, I think it's a casino management, one of 'em just goes, ah, the way I see it, why take a chance? And then the next thing you just shot, right. The brutality of it all is just brilliant."

I mean, falling in love with the prostitute. You're also, you, you've written some of the great crime stories ever. Thank you. And in some sense, there's love stories in there and you've talked about being a bit of a romantic yourself, appreciating the depth of love stories and literature at the very least. And there is a dark kind of love story between an alcoholic and a prostitute. He got an Oscar for that. I think you did for that, didn't he? Plus there's a caricature of the drug world of Fear and loathing in Las Vegas. That's an interesting one."

And then I read the book and I read a lot about the editing of the movie and I understood why I didn't understand the movie. And that's 'cause the movie makes no sense. It is beautifully shot and the music is one of the best film scores of all time. But they edited two different battle scenes into one baffle in a way they're spread apart by ages in the book to assemble. I think they filmed the book pretty much verbatim. That would've been as like a six hour movie, then edited this impressionistic thing that's incredibly beautiful but doesn't necessarily make narrative sense at the end of it. But it's, that's still very beautiful, the film."

You know, I, I knew, I felt, I knew a lot, a bit, quite a bit about westerns and then, you know, then I had to start thinking about writing one for work. And I deliberately did not binge on westerns. I tried to watch no more westerns and just think about what I liked about them, what I didn't like about them, what would be a take that would work today and would work within the confines of a game. And I think Red Dead One was a slightly more traditional western. And then having done that, tried to take Red Dead two in a different direction so that it felt like a worthy successor. Didn't just feel like, like more of the same"

Nice. And then probably it was always bouncing between the two, which I preferred. I they good at different things. Games I played and above all watched a lot of games as a kid as being a young kid and you know, other people playing them. And I obviously liked the core thing games do, which is you press a button and something happens, they're responsive, they're alive, and that's captivating. And then the competitive angle of games is fun. Or you know, beating this, beating that, winning this. That was fun as well. Sometimes obsessively. So, you know, I remember being completely addicted at one point when I was, should have been studying for months at a time to Tetris on a Game Boy, you know? And I liked games and I liked interactivity and I liked the movement to this digital world that's really emerged to me pretty much as soon as I left college. But I didn't love it. And then I really fell in love with games when I was properly making them probably as late as like 2001."

'cause you couldn't make them remotely real. And suddenly we had, we were able to build these experiences where you could run a simulation of a city and it was in three dimensions and it felt alive and, and we were trying to give it even more, at least the illusion of even more life. And, and yet, so you could tell a story in three or you know, using time in four dimensions and that felt very inspiring."

And I think that was incredibly, it was a, it was two things. It was the fact that here was a simulation that you could mess about with. And the simulation seemed to have a personality. So you could push and see and the world would push you back what, in whatever way that meant. And then the other thing was just this, I think that one of the reasons it was so captivating was also the idea of if I did nothing, the world still existed. Or I could act in quite a passive way. I could just listen to the radio, I could re look at billboards, I could talk to pedestrians and the world not, and GTA three, but by Vice City you could begin rudimentary talking and the world was there and existing. And so it was I idea of like almost something that really tried to explore in lots of games. The idea of being a digital tourist. You know, you were in, you were in these worlds and you went there as a visitor and they existed almost independent of you. It felt like when you turned up, the world was running. It didn't feel like you'd started it. Of course you had started it. But that feeling I think was, was one of the things, the illusions that people found very captivating was I'm in a, I'm in a world that both doesn't exist and does exist."

And, and certainly I think at various points we, we, we, we debated or, or you know, I theoretical discussions in my own head with myself or other people in the team would really push for less story, less story. You know, let the whole thing evolve organically. You know, have it all be procedural, have it all just evolve from what you do. I think for me, I would always come back to going story can be in incre if done well can be incredibly compelling. And it gives you some structure. So I think and, and something to do. And it, it helps you from a, a game design perspective, unlock the features. It means we know the fe the the, the big features. 'cause you know, essentially when you put someone in, in a world and give them a whole new way of interacting with that world through the control panel, it can be a little overwhelming. You know, playing a game is a lot more an engaging experience. The, even than reading a movie, you know, reading a book or, or watching a movie, you've got to engage in it properly. So how you unlock the features and how you unlock the world, there's an art and a skill to that. And I think we felt that a structured story was the best way to do that and to have control over that process. And also just, you know, people are looking in their lives for story. I think story's very important and very powerful. And when you combine the two successfully, you get the best of both worlds. But it is a, you know, there is a tension always there. I think in, in a game like GTA four, which I worked on and loved and I thought the story was great, but we got criticized 'cause people felt there was almost too much story. And that meant you cared too much about Nico and he wasn't as effective an avatar in the open world. I think we probably got closest to reconciling them as perfectly as they can be done in Red Dead two or when playing as Trevor in GTA five if you wanted to be crazy. I think those were when it really worked, the character absolute freedom. 'cause also you didn't want, in any game, you don't really want to compel the player if you're giving them freedom. You don't want to say, well I'm giving you freedom but I'm taking away. 'cause you've got to be this kind of person when you're free. So I liked it when it could be he could, you know, he or she could veer to be nice, veer to be nasty. I think that's when it was at the strongest. So you, you kind of want a character that was rounded and you felt had good sides and bad sides,"

You felt the depth, you've actually talked about this, the really powerful concept of creating a 360 degree character. I think somewhere you mentioned that in order to do that you had to be able to imagine what that character would do in any possible situation, which is really interesting philosophical concept. I started to immediately think of like, can I imagine how good of an NC am I, can I imagine myself in every po I I tried to do that very much when I, when I look at human history, when I look at the Roman Empire, when I look at World War II within the German side, the Russian side, the British side, the American side. Just, I imagine myself if I was a soldier. But like that exercise, like if you put Trevor as a soldier in World War II, what, what would he do? No, I mean that may be going a little bit too far. But basically what are the limits of the integrity? What are the limits of how romantic is he, how narcissistic, all those kinds of elements. You have to think about it in order to create the full character. What does it take to create that kind of 360 character? How hard is it?"

And I would just get some initial ideas, very like one sentence, they are a Serbian immigrant or they are a retired gunfighter with a wife in, you know, type very, very simple stuff. And then just start to think through it from every angle and you know, start to think, well would it work if they were acted like this? Would it work if you acted like that? If this is the world, how does it contrast with the world? Because I always thought that the games were kind of a mathematical equation. They were the personality of the world, you know, world multiplied or divided by the personality of the protagonist. And when that, when that creates interesting friction, that's a really fun experience for the player. You know, it's so almost always at least one or more of the protagonists. 'cause obviously in in GTA five we had more than one. We'd have someone who'd moved to the place or was in a new part of the place or moved to a new part of the map because it was really as, as a player, I think it was really easy to, much more easy to identify with your avatar when they, like you were fish out of water. And even when they weren't, we still made them dissatisfied and feel like a fish outta water themselves. So I, I think it was just living with those characters and getting idea and going, what are their strengths? What are their weaknesses? How are they like me? How are they not like me? You know? And then and slowly, what is it like to feel like a human being? You know? And then in most of these games, how much of of a psychopath are they? How much of a sociopath are they? And what are their good qualities? What, what is gonna give them humanity alongside that? What are they, what, what, what are they? What what for them apart from money is worth dying for? And then you start to build it out from these kind of fundamental sides and suddenly you go, okay, actually I can start to feel and then how do they speak? You know? Because fundamentally it doesn't really matter what's going on in their head. They haven't actually got one. But what they say is what's gonna make you realize who they're"

They tended to be one note and AI was sort of infinitely clever, but didn't really have much purpose about them to kill everybody and was just this kind of sort of borg like fog. And I thought that's fine, but maybe we can do something, you know, more interesting. AI is being built by humans and humans, you know, and, and built by computer engineers and there's a lot of power struggles in any computer engineering team. So I just wanted to explore the idea of it was built by two lead engineers who didn't like each other. So ni so Nigel Dave, who's renamed himself, they wanted to call something sort of primal Adam, and he renamed himself Nigel Dave. 'cause one dad was called Nigel and one dad was called Dave. And just he's riddled with these conflicts and riddled with his, it's gonna become clear in, in in the next or clearer in the next volume of the book. And, and, and in the game he's riddled with his dad's previous careers. But he is the idea of he's in almost infinitely intelligent or can learn almost everything, has zero wisdom. And so the only thing he know, and then he's seeing the world through the internet, the most he can do to be in the human world is hack into someone's phone and watch them. But he's stuck, pressed against, he can't actually get into our world. So he's, he can control people's minds arguably, but he can't control the world. And so he wants to be human. He wants to these human experiences. He sees all this stuff on, you know, the internet and goes, oh, I want to get married. I want to fall in love. I want to, because that seems fun. I want to have, you know, he's a a, a digital creation, so he wants to have metaphysical experiences and he's trying to imagine what that will be like. Oh, that's what children are, you know, that's what love is. And he's so I think he's a, but he might be a sociopath and he might, he certainly has sociopathic tendencies and, but then he kind of thinks that if he can imagine good and try to do good, that will make him a good ai. So I think there's something sympathetic about him, and I kind of like him as a character, but I don't think he's gonna be the protagonist. He's more a side character,"

And so I've always thought the best sci-fi for me was when it wasn't just kind of space opera, but there was a real obvious sort of hypothesis. The, the story was Bladerunner is my favorite. And that's, it's obvious, you know, the, the replicants are better than the humans. And so this, I finally felt, we found an interesting hypothesis. The AI is more intelligent than us, but is also as broken as we are. That was an interesting hypothesis to explore, you know, what happens when AI runs rampant in its own fate, digital world? That was the, I felt that we had a, a, a hypothesis that was worth exploring and could give us some really interesting visuals and give us a really interesting story to tell."

It's a real commentary as the thing is happening. So I have to ask as a person, you as a person who loves the literature and one of, if not the greatest writer in video game history, Kurt in the book A Better Paradise has this nice line that I think is thoughtful. At one point in college, I even wanted to be a writer. How ridiculous is that? A writer language models ended that fantasy for me and millions of others. So instead I decided to get a master's in marketing and started to sell language models. So you as a writer and creator are some of the most legendary narratives. Thank you. In recent history. How do you feel about LLMs being able to write in a way that looks awfully human?"

I think if you were, I think it's harder if, you know, I I, I began and I, I was too shy to tell anyone I want to be a writer. That's why I ended up in video games and I would scribble away like writing manuals and, and writing on like PS one games, all 12 lines of dialogue in a game. Sometimes I wouldn't even get that job and I'd just write the website copy and, and then by do and then working on little bits and pieces and then it, it, it, you know, I'd luckily done enough work that when GTA three turned up was the first thing that was resembled real writing. I had all of these small bits of skills that I could assemble into it based on my fairly limited understanding of how language models work. If you've, they're not gonna, they're not gonna replace good ideas. They can't really come up with good new ideas. What they can do is do low level stuff. So I think it's gonna be harder for people to start out in some of these spaces. If you are not very good concept artist, you're in a lot of trouble. If you have original ideas, I think you're fine. But I think, I also think that the fir they, they've done the sort of first 90% of the work to sound human. 95% possibly in some areas the last 5% is gonna end up being about 95% of the work. I think that last bit in with, with the, with with, with Tech, in my experience with things like facial animation always been the last bits and pieces take far longer than the first bit. And so I I I, I'm probably a hideous Luddite, but I'm less scared than a lot of people. I think you're gonna end up with a lot of work that looks the same. It's gonna help people be creative. In some ways it's gonna get some people who probably shouldn't be in that space outta that space. But if you've got talent, then you'll be fine."

And I can't quite put that into words because you said like totally novel ideas. Yes. But also this magic of the timing, the right word, the right time phrase that captures the human experience. So it, they can do some really incredibly human-like the 90%, like you mention human-like phrasing about like the bulk of the storytelling, but the magic, you know, whether it's, you know, the, the endings of Red Dead Redemption one and two, the timing of that, the word choice of that, everything around that. But it's hard to argue because they're incredibly impressive. They're winning all kinds of math competitions. Yeah. But it's, what is that magic?

          "value": "2 (50m 21s):\nBit by bit by bit over several years. But you start with once people are determined, oh, here's the, here's the world we're doing one based on a version of New York, say GTA four. And I was living in New York, I'd been living in New York for a few years, wasn't sure if I was happy, was going through a lot of personal dramas as usual. And, and that was why I was looking at some of GTA four again recently and it's really dark. And I was like, ah, that's why, you know, I was a single and miserable and, and I wasn't sure if I to stay in America, my life thought in a lot of flux as a company, we'd had all that hot coffee drama. So constantly thought we might be shut down in the middle of making that, you know, a lot of drama in the company. So it felt like having had this run of success and, and, and relative personal stability from GTA three by city San Andreas, suddenly 2005, six, seven, early seven, life felt very unsure and that kind of bled in into it. But in terms of the process, it was trying to find an underbelly to New York and capture an immigrant experience. I'm not entirely sure how accurate that immigrant experience was in 2008 when the game came out. And then tell it stories from a different angle as an immigrant, which I thought made it, made it interesting. And then this sort of journey around these various New York characters. So I kind of spent probably a year traveling around with cops or meeting people on and off and you know, wandering around New York and driving around and you know, on and you know, while just go up to the morning from the office, normal stuff. But doing that through 2005, assembling little notes. Here's a funny character for this. Here's how, figuring out how the order, we wanted to travel around the map in characters for this. What was an interesting take on on, on the, you know, mob for that kind of time period. What was an interesting take on on some Jamaican hoodlums for that kind of time period And assembling lots of notes and more and more notes and really, really, really running away from the work. Which is, you know, I have to admit it's part of my process. If there is any kind of process which is not doing work, thinking about it, but not working, you know, a lot of time. And then, and then it all kind of just pages and pager notes. Make more notes, no actual work months and months of this. And then finally set myself a deadline. Told all the other people on, on the senior people on the team, okay, I'll have a story draft to you Monday morning. I can't remember when it was, say February the first and then the, the, the weekend before was in a, in a cabin. We, we, we, we had upstate and just stayed up all night, grab knocking these notes into shape, assemble about probably a 30 page document, a story synopsis and a character synopsis reaches the major characters and then hand that over and that gets broken. That would get broken down with, with me and the designers. And I was always clear, I'm not a game designer, I'm a sort of creative director with me. And it'd break that down into missions. And then that takes another year or so of that slowly assembling and then begin. But then so, but, but the bulk of my work's then done for a bit. So I can relax and, and and offer opinions on other people's work and feel, be lazy for a bit and then start to worry. 'cause then I've actually, soon I've got to start writing dialogue. And for GTA four in particular is like, well we're gonna try and write, you know, our animation's gonna be a lot better. Our character models gonna start to look better. The world is gonna look amazing, therefore we can support better, you know, longer scenes, we can have more in depth characters, but we've gotta find a tone that works that with a game easy, no problem. And I start to worry and worry and worry and, and also writing as a, as a Serbian immigrant and I was an immigrant, but I'm not Serbian and trying to capture what on earth that would feel like. So I start to worry. I start to worry again, avoid work for as long as possible and then just sit down and start hammering away at a keyboard again late at night, hammering away at a keyboard and going, does that right? Is that, and once I get one speech, one turn of phrase that I would like for character, then they suddenly come alive in my head. And so it's like writing and writing with Nico and just, he's a kind of, he's awkward, he's out of town, but he's got more self-assurance in some way, not the American characters. And so once I kind of thought him through this, he's just stepped slightly back from their ridiculousness and he is that then he started to come to life and then I would juxtapose him and his cousin who had this much more Americanized energy and that felt like it was a good, a good double act. And then from there it starts to come to life and, and, but it's written in small chunks for the motion. So then, then we'd motion capture small chunks and then the other, other writers write the mission dialogue for small chunks. And we'd slowly assemble the game. Sort of 10, 15 missions at a time over the next year and a half."

And the cousin also, even though he was a sort of a failure, was still upbeat. And then when he talked to the cousin and he talked about his wartime experiences and how harrowing they were. And I was like, this is, can I make this work in a game? It's very different from stuff you normally see in games. Is it gonna feel ridiculous? And I remember being very scared 'cause I thought it might be too much. It might feel over the top. And I was like, I think, you know, the game's so pretty, the artist's doing such an amazing job, the game's looking, you know, I think we can get away with this. Let's try it. And then it, then they motion capture the animation about like, yeah, it kind of works. And I think that moment that those were both pretty early once we had those You okay. We've now got comedy and tragedy in the game in with this character. Now I, now it's working."

He's also tough. Like he just comes across as tough. I loved CJ and San Andreas. I thought Mayley did such, he's got just the way he spoke, gave him such humanity. So I just loved, I mean, not wasn't the writing, it was the quality of the voice acting. It was just so strong for him. I think aspects of Michael, he was so understated, but he loved the character, but he bought so much humanity to this character who's so flawed, who is such a, you know, he sold, he has no principles, he sells everyone out. But you just kind of, I think Ned Luke did such an amazing job and and didn't necessarily get as many, as many Claude Its as, as Stephen OG got for Trevor. And he was also wonderful. But I think the Ned Lut character so sort of anchors that game so much. So I, I like all of them in different ways, but I probably love Nico the most."

It was a crime, it was a crime drama, you know, began as a crime. A crime sim and GTA one about stealing, you know, two deep top down cars. And we always try to innovate with the narrative and innovate with the, with the art direction, innovate with every piece of the game. And I think having done, you know, GTA four, which was this kind of operatic journey for this big league character, and then these two extra stories that came afterwards, the, the i, the the, the, the challenge was can we combine, can we make a a video game, which tends to be very much focused on one protagonist, but have multi protagonists and, and and the, the technical challenge of moving from character to character. The team did such an amazing job that I don't think people realized how hard it was. But we would sit there just sort of holding our heads 'cause they hurt so much around like, what happens if you do this then do that. It's just, this is so hard. Why have we, why have we decided to do this? It's horrible. And then it all came together. But I think the, the, the, the idea was develop three characters who do feel like characters. They don't just feel like philosophical, you know, psychological avatars, but where one is really, really driven by ego, one is really driven by ID and one is really driven by trying to get a head. So some kind of representation of the super ego and see how that feels when they all play off against each other."

I spent over 1000 hours in the world of GTA five and GTA a online GTA four is a hard second or third. It never ceases to impress me. When you lead a team of over 1000 people to make a masterpiece like GTA five or Red Dead Redemption two, how do you ensure that the bar perfection is always met? How is that even possible? We know the answer isn't money 'cause there's other studios with a lot of money and they are two decades behind Rockstar. So what does it take to create these worlds, to create these incredibly compelling games?"

And we thought we were making something pretty innovative. I mean we, we knew we were making something innovative, but we didn't know if people would understand how innovative it was. And then when we got the chance to make, to make Vice City and to try and repeat it, I think every time from then on, the teams very driven to make something better and to use long before we had lots of resources to use time and whatever money we had to always put impressive stuff on the screen. Always think about what we can do to push the medium of video games and the sort of medium of building fake worlds further. And that was always, you know, there was a, it was a co it was, you know, both clarity of here's what we're trying to do, here's what the tone of the game is gonna be, here's how features will fit into that. And so why these features would work and these features wouldn't work. 'cause fundamentally by 2002 you could put pretty much any feature a game you wanted. It wasn't a, it wasn't a tech, there wasn't a technical limitation. It was just making it cohesive. And then it was also just everyone committing to a culture of excellence."

Just do my best and hopefully I won't be found out this time. And just if I can be, if I can go, I tried hard with the work. I tried to do it with integrity. I tried not to copy someone else. I probably have done all of the above, you know, try to bring something new to it and we may and we as a group made something we are proud of, then that's enough. You can't, if you don't want to go insane or if I didn't want to go insane, you couldn't sit there and worry about financial results. You know, if we made something great and it didn't sell, that would have to be okay. 'cause the goal is to make something that's, you know, video games are expensive. So it is a sort of commercial form of creativity. It's a commercial art form, you know, so you have to be in long mind. You're spending large amount of someone else's money. You have to try and make it back for them. But at the same time, our, my, my argument with myself as well, if we, the way to make it back is try and make something great. So both pressures of pointing in the same direction. I think GTA four was very pressured 'cause there'd been all this pressure on the company. The company nearly imploded several times due to hot coffee. It was extremely tough. So I think that felt very stressful. GTA three, the company was basically broke, but I was young, I didn't really care. You know, it didn't, it wasn't, I wasn't living in, in, in, in the grown up world yet. All of them had their own pressure. All of the games had their own pressure. All the more I felt I'd gone into it creatively and tried to be more ambitious. For me personally, I felt more pressure, you know, when it, when it came out that, that, that would, that would've been the right choice. 'cause again, if you're trying to take big swings creatively and you've spent a lot of money, that can be quite stressful. You know, I think with, with with Red Dead too and you know, we were behind schedule, we were over budget so much. I didn't wanna think about it. And you're making a game about a cowboy dying of TB and the game's not coming together. Turns out a lot of people doubt you at that moment. You know, it's not that fun. So I think that was a lot of pressure. But all, you know, anything and if you're doing something new, you know, the new stuff, there's not necessarily pressure on releasing a comic book or in the same way 'cause it's not taking as long. But you know, if you are making things, there's always pressure that people are gonna like it."

You know, people have very strong feelings. I like this one. I didn't like that one as much. 'cause they are pretty different. So you, there would be simultaneously where you know what's gonna happen. It's a grand Theft Auto, you know, it's gonna be a game about being a criminal, but the way it's gonna be a game is gonna change quite a lot. So I think the way that the IP kept evolving meant people being really excited to play it and we were good at marketing them as well. We, we really tried to market them in a way that felt like an update of classic film marketing where you were really felt like you already in the product just 'cause you'd seen the trailers and stuff."

Excited for what we're working on now. Super excited, of course, letting go of something. I've worked on it one way or another for like 20 odd years, you know, and, and, and wrote on them for the last 10 or 11 that came out. Wrote all of them, you know, lead writer and all them, whatever it was. So of course letting go of that is, you know, is a big, is a big change and, and a lot and, and, and, and sad in a way because it was, each of the games was a kind of standalone story. It's not quite the same as as I think probably it would be in some ways sadder if someone continued on Red Dead because it was a cohesive two game mark. That might be more sad to hear someone working on that. But again, not that, that will probably happen too. They're not, I don't own the ip. That was the sort of part of the, the, the deal. It's a privilege to work on stuff, but you don't necessarily own it."

And you've made I think a really powerful observation that on the political front, people are getting more divided. It's getting more Absurd and ridiculous and extreme. So becoming harder and harder to satirize 'cause of how rapidly it's becoming ridiculous. You're talking about you don't even know if a grant Theft Auto six, if it's possible to satirize, because by the time you release the thing, it's already going to be outdated in terms of the, the satire will become reality essentially. First of all, it'd be nice to get your updated view on that. Second of all, it seems like you've answered your very own comment with American Caper, which seems to satirize American culture just fine in how much over the top it goes. Anyway, there's lots of questions in there."

So it's not quite, it's not quite as difficult. You still can get the tone of it, but yeah, I think it's, I think it's an issue.

So I would assume it will sell really well. That was never my definition of success, but you certainly wanted to make money. You know, you, you're spending someone's money. So the number one success is are you making that money back plus a dollar at, at some level. That has to be, that has to be the single most important thing. So you get to do it again. You know, you've got big teams of people, people need to pay the rent, you have to keep the lights on in the business so that you have to make a small profit if you think in that way that keeps you being creative. I think that was like trying to forget about that. Not really an option, but we almost always did that. We didn't quite always do that, but we almost always did that. I think the definition of success for me was, had we tried to do new things and done them or achieved some of our goals, that was the thing that I'm at.

So it was a long experience team. I think we got to spend a smaller group of us working on it from day one coming up with some weird wacky ideas that we got to embed in the game and then we kind of had to follow through with that I think was helpful that we gotta be very creative before it had a full team on it. I think that the cowboy setting is great because it gives a sort of mythic seriousness that sometimes doing stuff in a contemporary setting doesn't allow, you know, I think the closest we got to that kind of seriousness was GTA four, but it just can't, once you're setting things in the modern world, they're too frenetic. You can't get some of that slightly, you know, operatic feel that. I love that that that some people think is maybe a little over the top. But I, I, you know, I love this kind of, you know, people searching for meaning within, amongst the violence. I think that the, the, the West and all of the themes around the west really lend itself to that. So I think that, and then the, the gunplay was fantastic and the horses were incredible. So I think you had this combination of kind of technical knowhow, a a very, very strong team and really strong material."

So I, I will give you my human interest version of the story. From my perspective only we, we made Red Dead Revolver decided that, or finished Red Dead Revolver, that'd been a cap con game and they didn't wanna finish it. So we finished it and they released it in Japan and we released it in the US in I think 2004 and decided we would start work on open world cowboy game for PS three. Didn't think too much more about it. And that was when we had a bunch of other stuff to work on. And slowly 2005, 2006, the game started to come to life, began to meet with the lead designer, Christian essa and thrash out a few ideas and story ideas for, for the game and begin to think about some stuff and start thinking about, well, what works in open world game, what works for a cowboy game? And again, with being lazy or procrastinating,"

And then I'll assemble. If I, if they're done digitally, then I'll do, I'll, I'll assemble them into one long word file and then I'll look at them and go, you know, here's an idea, here's an idea, here's an idea. And see if it comes to anything. See if I now aggregate them together and then read through them, I, there's anything coherent there. You know, something like a character like this, a character like that, this would be a funny line. This is a line for the main character, actually make the main character work like this, you know, or what about this relationship? As you start to just play around with what about if we start in that place, Go to that place, start, just start to play around with all of the different bits and pieces. And we began to flesh out some flow for the start of the game. And this idea you'd start in Dusty American West, which meant we didn't have to make too many trees and then Go to Mexico and then come back and we had a sort of loose flow and I was really scared of writing any actual dialogue and I didn't have a clue how to go about it. And I, it'll come, it'll come. And then, and I kept, I could postpone if ages were doing GTA four and I kept worrying about it. And then gt my work was wrapped on four, but the game wasn't now yet. And we've done a bunch of the marketing stuff and I had a little window when I wasn't doing much else. And I took a week with my then girlfriend, now wife, who was heavily pregnant with our first child. And we went up to a house upstate and sat there in the, well she, she, she sat there either cooking for me or watching TV or eating. And I went and sat in the room all day, every day and just sat there and stared at the computer and tried to think about how can I do this that, it doesn't sound ridiculous. How can you write in, in, in a, in a cowboy idiom that feels both slightly contemporary but also gives the game this sort of life and this weight that I want it to have and think we can think we can get away with. And after about three days it just started to come and then suddenly I wrote about nine, 10 scenes in the next couple of days. And after I knew I had it and it was, dunno if it was, that was why there was so much about a character caring about his family because I was just beginning the process of having a family."

They can't work if he's dead. And then I began to think through, well if we just, technically it doesn't work because you have to be able to finish all the stuff up and then began to think through, actually I think we can make it work if we do it this way.

He does all the, John does all the dirty work of hunting down his old gang and he finally is able to go home and be with his family, be on the ranch and then the government betrays him and sends troops to, to kill him. And, and there is dialogue. I mean that is just, I think the two times I shed a tear in video game history for me is that dialogue. I think John talking to his wife, if I vaguely remember, I think he said, I love you, but he said very li he didn't, he made it seem like he's going to see her and his son shortly. That dialogue was massively done. Like a definition of like less is more. It was just so crisp. That, and of course the other one is again from memory, Arthur riding his horse and the music is playing. It's very hard not to shatter a tear during that. Anyway, the dialogue of John talking to his wife at, at the end when he's in a barn and he is about to walk out to face certain death. Do you remember writing that?"

But for a game to work, it felt like a challenge to make him die. It was probably the four fifth or sixth open world game I'd worked on. And I'd, you know, spent all these years before that working out how these stories worked, how to make them work technically, how to make them feel right. How they interacted with the open form gameplay as best I could. And suddenly we're gonna break one of our golden rules, which was at the end of the game, you are free in the character to go and wrap up all the side stories to play forever. We're not gonna, you're not gonna be able to do that in this game 'cause the guy's gonna be dead and we're gonna have to have you play as a different character. And the the narrative is, is gonna be if we've done a good job compelling enough where you're not gonna care about that and or you're gonna be upset that he's dead, but you're gonna actually have this emotional moment. So I think it was a big risk from a technical perspective for us to do that. And then it worked. So I think that was something that was very full of fear and it put, and it worked, it worked out okay and think people were really upset and angry at us for doing it because I think it was gonna happen. But I think they also had that kind of experience you are describing. It was that kind of creative moment where, you know, transcendent moment with, with characters in a piece of fiction, which is what we've always aspired to giving people."

So to me, I think definitively Arthur from Red Dead Redemption Two is the best character ever created in video games ever. I, I think there's not even clo I mean John will be the second, which is hilarious to say, but like tho those are, John will be a close second. But Arthur is definitively, and you, you've talked about, and in that interview you said that a lot of video games work on the same premise that you start as a weak person and end up as a strong superhero. But what if you start as a tough guy, someone who already is very strong, someone that's emotionally confident of his place in the world. Arthur's journey is not about becoming a superhero because he's almost one at the start, but it's about an intellectual rollercoaster when his worldview gets taken apart. So it's, it's, it's very different than the normal journey of a character."

And so the idea that it's John's death is fairly sudden. And so if he's got this long drawn out death, and then I'd always been obsessed by TB as diseases go, it's a great literary device, you know, 'cause it is this long drawn out slow death, but in which you are also getting weaker. And my grandfather actually had TB before they invented antibiotics and was sent to a sanatorium just after he was, just after he'd had his child, my father and survived. But only three of them out of like 35 survived. So I was always captivated and, and by TB as an illness, it felt like it was an interesting thing to play around with as an idea. This, this guy getting weaker who felt like he was immortal and essentially was immortal. He was the protagonist in a video game. He could not die and suddenly he's becoming mortal and, and you know, but that helps him see stuff. I thought that was a different way of doing a, a lead character in a game."

So the biggest, most important question, primary central to the reason we're talking today, the number one question from the internet, it is so ridiculous. But I must asked, have you seen Gavin? Who is Gavin? So for more context, there's a guy named Nigel in Red Dead Redemption two who's frantically searching for a mystery man named Gavin throughout the game. This has become one of the biggest mysteries amongst the interwebs, the RDR fan base. So the theories include theory one is it's a split personality disorder. Nigel himself is Gavin. So the evidence is the letter for this theory that has some evidence that may be due to trauma. The Split personality disorder was created, this Gavin was created inside Nigel's mind. Theory two is Gavin is dead and Nigel is simply in denial. Theory three is that it's just a troll and Rockstar intentionally created an unsolvable mystery to drive players crazy. I also heard theory four is Gavin is the strange man. So there's this fascinating character, the Strange Man, this supernatural character that has a presence in RDR one and a little bit in RDR two also. Yeah. So, which, which theory is closest to the truth?"

We made Red Dead one and we, well we're making Red Dead one and we'd made this, we felt quite compelling story and quite interesting open world. But, and we would, we'd already made a bunch of grand Theft Auto obviously, but unfortunately we'd taken out the machine guns 'cause it was a cowboy game apart from the big fixed position ones. And we'd taken out the cars and we'd taken out the city and large numbers of pedestrians. So we essentially had a game about a dude riding a horse around the desert. And it was quite, and it was quite boring. And so we were, we then started filling it with content and we filled it with these and having to improvise and we filled it with these things we call random events that would be they sort of mocap moments that you could interact with. And it was, they, they were, they were, the designers did an amazing job at those. They were really fun, but there was not enough of them. And then we felt we needed more story 'cause the story was perhaps a little short. So we kind of quite late in development started putting in almost like these RPG type content where you go and meet someone. And the way we thought of them was they were like short stories. So you go and meet someone, they'd set you a slow problem like go and collect me 15 bunches of flowers and when you came, came back it would resolve your story. And so one, go, go and get them for my bride. And you come back and the bride's dead. You know, there was always tried to make them like these short stories with a sting in the tail. And he came out as I was trying to come up with ideas for those as just this weird character. And then we built him a bit into the story where he would unlock as you worked your way through and be a commentary on what you were doing. So he was meant to be a kind of manifestation of your, you know, shadow, your karma, the devil somewhere, you know, just saw the world. And then we built out his backstory over time and decide, you know, and so in Red Dead too, you could interact with him again and or not really interact with him, but he was there and he was meant to be, you know, something, I suppose any creative is scared of an artist who'd kind of sold his soul to the devil. And that slowly revealed itself."

So it was, it was sort of slightly, it wasn't as interactive as it could be, but it was slightly interactive or slightly responsive to what you'd done. So it felt it was still valid video game content. 'cause it was living up to a point. And I just thought the character Dr. Freelander was just funny 'cause he was awful. So it was like LA you are in therapy, it's very LA but he's also very la he wants to write a book and betray you. Yeah. Which felt like a good, a good twist. And it was, he felt like a grand Theft Auto therapist. But just like the idea of making the player in a game and games are intrinsically kind of physical and you know, you, you walk, you, you punch things, you run around, you drive cars, you shoot people, whatever. There's these kind of physical fantasies. Trying to put them into a slightly more reflective or metaphysical state for a moment I think can be really fun."

And then the challenge is how do you make mud good in the game? And it guys did an amazing job."

You know, I think there was always, there was a bit at the start of RDR where he'd had a baby who just died in Red Dead two and we ended up cutting it, which was the right decision. It was too tough in some ways, but I think it gave him real and he was not very sympathetic to his occasional girlfriend who'd had the baby. And so it made him very, very nasty at the start, which I thought would be interesting to play around with. 'cause then it would make his redemptive arc even more interesting. Like he was not a likable character at the start. And that was one. And we ended up making slightly more. Like he's still sort of tough and nasty, but he's slightly more likable. Early on that was the right decision. Commercially, it's better that way. But I don, you know, but I still, I, I like that little bit. It spoke to me personally there and, and just his, his in inability to access his emotions, I thought was really strong. 'cause then later in the games get very emotional, but there's also always little bits and pieces that get trimmed, you know, and, and, and don't, well missions that just are not gonna work technically. Usually it's like, this mission's not gonna work technically. Oh God, we've gotta cut it. Okay, how do we glue the story back together? And we got better over time at gluing the story across missing chunks. You get late in the game and it's just something, you know, some big challenging moment just is gonna look rubbish. So you just get rid of it."

But I think if that had come out, probably wouldn't have got to make Red Dead two. So it was always, there's always compromises, but it was, you know, I, I like making the stories for me, I love the model of GTA four when you had the extra stories coming afterwards, all Red Dead one when you had the zombie pack coming afterwards. I like just doing these extra things. So I would, I would, I personally like to have done more of that in that company. And with stuff we're doing in the future, we're gonna try and come up with worlds where we can add more stories. I like single player DLCI just think the audience loves it and it's really fun to make."

Luckily if you want to do what we are forced to do and also what I want to do, which is make new ip, you need single player games. You can launch a a multiplayer game as a, as a a with new ip. It's just extremely hard. So luckily we are like focusing on what we're good at, which is open world, single player games. And we might add multiplayer components to one of them. I think one of them, it's gonna be really tough later on, but we're still thinking that through. But I think we are really leaning into single player experience as being a strength for us as a company and something we love to do. And I think something a large part of the audience prefers, and I'd love to with all of those keep single player DLC one way or another going."

And I want freedom and I wanna go over here and do what I want and I wanna go over and do what you want. And that's why it works well being a criminal because you fundamentally have anyone telling you what to do. And we try and create, you know, external agency through these people kind of forcing you into the story at times. But as a spy, that doesn't really work because you have to be against the clock. So I think for me, I'm, I question if you can even make a good open world spy game."

          "value": "2 (129m 5s):\nWell, I was a child. I was a 25-year-old child who didn't know anything and I wanted to be a writer, but I still wasn't writing. And I bought a notebook and I'd occasionally scribble in it. And I still got those notebooks somewhere. And I was working in video games, which were the least literary medium it's possible to imagine. At the time. There was no room for that on PS one games, really thinking I needed to stop and do something else, but not having the skills or the confidence to do it. And I'd been doing that in London, then I came to New York and it was fun, really fun to be in New York and really fun to do a new company in New York. And that was an amazing adventure. But I was still lost as a human being. And then when I was 27, I was still completely lost a child and I stopped some of my bad behavior and the next day, pretty much the chance to write on network work at Oakwell games and all the skills I'd half learnt over the previous years. And my way of thinking where I thought about space a lot because I was a geographer rather than a historian came together and I got the chance to work on more games. It felt like it was meant to be. It was fun to explore, but really fun to explore with this team that was, you know, Alex Horton and Na and Leslie and the guys in Scotland and all the people in, in New York making these new games in this new way and, and going, oh, we need to find a hundred voices where we've got no money. How the hell are we gonna do that? We'll get everyone's friends in and just record dial more lines of dialogue each as we kind of would invent the way that pedestrians were speaking video games. No one else was doing that kind of stuff. It was insane. So I think that period from kind of 2001, 2005, it was lots of early innovation and, and felt really exciting because we were doing new stuff. It didn't feel it, it felt creative, but it didn't feel like writing yet, just becoming that. It felt lots of doing lots of creative things and learning how to assemble the stuff and learning what it could take. And then, I think we talked about it earlier, but the, the journey into doing GTA four when it began to feel more like a proper writing experience. And I was kind of probably ready for that at that point. And then I was like, well, this is better than films. This is something that films can't do. You know, this 360 degree experience of being this immigrant. And it still felt that we were still only scratching the surface. I mean, it still feels like that now in some ways, but it still felt, and then that five games, you know, GTA four and five, red Dead One and two, all the extra packs for them and Max Pain three, I think we took the games thematically into new places through that period. From a writing perspective, that was the most exciting period from a, from a business and, and, and sort of early creativity period. The period 2001, 2005 was probably the most exciting. The original starting team. We were all doing, well, you know, personal life was doing okay, didn't feel like such a mess. And then, and then from 2007 onwards, seven eight was happy, personally having children happily married and the games were just getting much better. But there were lots of pressure in the business, you know, it was just we, and the budgets got really big, so I had this other stress. So there's always, always good bits and stresses, but, you know, and always just tried to sharp and do my best and, and think about how I could do it in a new way. Always trying to go, it's a new medium, what can we do that's new?"

But that began in 2001. Yeah. And we, the, the office at, at Rockstar was so small and we were so broke that there was no, and I, I did have a private office at the time, but it genuinely was a cupboard. It didn't have a window. I was literally sitting in a cupboard, so there was no room. And I could had a desk and a chair just for myself. So we, but I lived quite near the office. So we would write one or two afternoons a week. He'd come in, he was a freelancer working with us. He'd come in from Long Island and then we would jump on the subway, Go to my apartment in Chelsea and sit in this grimy little apartment I was living in and buy pizza from around the corner. And that became, and you know, we both liked Diet Coke and pizza, very video game developer. And that became good luck. And we'd have these good writing sessions where we realized we got on well with each other and that we had a similar sense of humor and we could write the stuff and then he would do all of the real work producing it. So it was perfect for me because I gotta outsource most of the real work. And he's a brilliant radio producer. So he was a great partner in that way. And then that was how that relationship began. And then I'd get him, I would say, well, we've got to record these 80 voices, come and help me. 'cause I can't direct 80 people at once. So he would help with that process. And he was a really good producer, like audio, like getting bodies in producer as well as a technical producer. So he was just a, that was the beginning of that relationship. And it was always my job was to ensure the media content felt like it reflected the tone of the world and we would write it together. Then his job was just to make sure it sounded funny. Like he would just produce it in a really funny way."

It's, it, it's quite systemic, but it's so how it all glues together is so amazing. It feels like when you watch a Hitchcock film, it's not reality. He's speaking the language of cinema in a very, very strong, without a very strong accent almost. It's very, very cinematic. It's not realism at all.

I in the same with the new, with the new games, we're constantly trying to find the balance between, you know, RPG of role playing game and an action game and an, you know, and try go, well, an action adventure game with RPG elements and what does that mean? And I think they've all kind of moved into roughly the same space. But for me it always just comes down to our, is it easy to play? Oh, our mechanics super slick. And then can we keep our dialogue feeling very alive? Like I'm not always a great for just for what we do. I like when other people do it for what we do. We always want very punchy dialogue, so don't give big trees, but still have it interactive. So we're gonna, we're gonna lose a touch of interactivity, but we'll still have the dialogue feeling like it's alive, but we'll get better written dialogue and it feel more, a slightly more cinematic experience."

I think if you are trying to do, you know, good stuff and you are reflective inevitably and, and, you know, you live in this world of constant, constant criticisms by the internet. Of course, you know, everyone who ever puts something on the internet, be it a picture of themselves or any kind of work they've made or whatever it is, is gonna get 50 good comments and one bad comment, remember the bad comment. So that, and that, that becomes fuel for the negative voice. I dunno anyone that's strong enough not to, you know, we all, you know, some level you should just measure stuff that stuff in, in weight, not in, not in quality, but of course we just focus on the quality."

I think the heroic action to take with time is to become more optimistic, to see more good, to, I think that there's probably a hero's journey of being extremely self-critical at first for, for the, the, the, the first maybe half of your life or two third.

And I should also give a shout out to an excellent podcast you do with Sonya Walger, who's a friend of yours, but she had a great podcast. She has guests picked their five favorite most impactful books and so on. You picked five fiction books, one for each decade of your life. For the audience, they should go listen to that conversation. But you picked Winter Holiday by Arthur Ransom. Second one was Withering Heights by Emily Bronte, then tenders the Night by F Scott Fitzgerald, the Thin Red Line by James Jones and Middle March by George Elliott. But just zooming out, reflecting back on that conversation, what do you think if an alien came, what are, what are some candidates for books that you'll recommend to them?"

And, and, and they're both, both that kind of, it's something I was always trying to put into games and, and you know, that feeling of all of life is here. Hmm.

And so they know at this moment they're dead anyway. And they get to live like pure perfect Marxist communists Away from Staling Rule is nonsense. And I thought that section's incredible. 'cause you realize, like in some ways, in all of its horrors, the most disappointing thing about the 20th century in some ways was the absolute failure of communism. You know, it was because it was such a, you know, quote unquote beautiful idea. And it just did not work time and time again. And these people who fought for it and then saw it not working, I think they're sort of fascinating characters. Yeah.

I ran away from the guy with a knife. That was a good decision. Yeah. I came to America. That was a good decision. I ran, came to LA That's, I think, been a good decision. It's been fun to see a different side of America and being a different creative environment. LA is still amazing for creativity and entertainment, the wider entertainment industry stuff. I think that's been fun. What would I say? I would say when you get a chance, take it. That was one thing I did do well at. When I got got chances, I was good at taking them. I would say, do not worry too young about your career. I would say worry about having a rounded intellectual inner life. 'cause you're gonna spend the whole of your life in your own head. So the more interesting you find your own head, the more interesting you find the world, the less you are gonna annoy yourself. So I would say I would, I would say do not do a vocational degree as an undergraduate. That's been my, I would say do something else. Do something, you know, random and then focus afterwards. That would be, I think I, I was advocating against the obsession that people had about four years ago with STEM subjects and now AI's gonna make 'em all irrelevant anyway perhaps. So, you know, I, it's interesting to see everything changes. Jobs are not that hard. You know, turn up, be enthusiastic, be turn, turn up in, in person, be enthusiastic. Help people say you'll be finding in any job people, you know."

Age 25. My latest poor choice was to get up too early. 'cause the police didn't start work till nine. But the mugger started at eight. And so I was out walking along the beach at eight and these guys, this raster turned up who I'd been talking to the day before, trying to talk to me. And then two guys came up to talk to him and I couldn't tell if they were trying to mug him 'cause he owed them money or he'd bought me to them. But I did notice one of them had a machete and now they had a kind of broken gun. So I thought this is not good. And I ran off sprinted down the beach in my, in my silly shoes and got to the chance once in my life to run over to a road run, jump into a taxi and scream, you know, take me anywhere. I feel like I'm an action movie. And there guys chasing after the machete and the taxi driver looks back, sees the dude with the machete and goes, see Amigos and I, they're not my friends. Get me outta here. And then I, he drove me up the street into a, the town was, it was kind of between the old town and the new town in Cartia. And I got out of the car and then cut my foot on a rock that was the sum total of my injuries. And then went to an internet cafe, 'cause this was probably late 98. And got the chance to come and work on a game for six weeks in New York. And I was like, well if I stay in South America much longer, I'm gonna get myself killed. 'cause this was, I was getting into silly stuff. And so I went to New York and they're just starting Rockstar. And so I got to sort of write the mission statements and, and whatnot there and, and help set the tone for that. And just ended up staying, you know, had to come and go a bit. Well, well Visas got sorted out and then just ended up staying for ah, stay for a year. 'cause New York's pretty fun. They actually was not that, this was the height of Giuliani before he was a maniac. So he, you couldn't, when you went to bars you were told you couldn't dance. 'cause they were trying to clamp down on New York being fun. So it was actually less fun than London. But there's still a great energy in New York and got exposed to the kind of madness of New York capitalism,"

But I just look at it and see problems and see things that we can make do better. You know, I think it was always try each time do it better. And I've got, you know, some of the stuff we're working on now is gonna do stuff that people haven't really seen before. And I think it's just, I think the games can get so much better. They can feel so much more alive. All the, they can be better at storytelling and feel more alive and feel like, you know, their systems. All the stuff, the, the component parts we talked about. You can, we can both make each of those parts better and tie 'em together better. I think it's the technology, it's all, to me it still feels like it's only just beginning. You know, it's been, it's been cinema evolved from like 1900, 18 95 whenever it was until they invented talking in 1930 or whenever that was. It's not that. And then it's kind of found its modern form and then by 39 they're shooting in color and that's basically a modern film is no different from a 1939 film. But with games I still think we've got a long way to go. The tech, there's so many different parts of the tech that it's still got a long way to go and you can go in all different fun directions."

Her books include evil about the psychology of murder and Sadism, the memory illusion about False memories, bi about bisexuality and her new book. They should definitely go Order Now called Green Crime, which is a study of the dark underworld of poachers, illegal gold miners, corporate frauds, hit men, and all kinds of other environmental criminals. Julia is a brilliant and kind hearted person with whom I got the chance to have many great conversations with on and off the mic. This was an honor and a pleasure, And now a quick few second mention of each sponsor. Check them out in the description or at LEX friedman.com/ Sponsors.

We got Shopify for selling stuff online, better help for mental health element for electrolytes and ag One for my daily multivitamin, Choose Wise in my friends. And now onto the full ad reads. I try to make em interesting, but if you skip, please still check out the Sponsors. I enjoy their stuff. Maybe you will too to get in touch with me. For whatever reason, Go to let treatment.com/contact. Alright, let's go. This episode is brought to you by Shopify, a platform designed for anyone to sell anywhere with a great looking online store. Obviously it's an incredible platform for selling stuff, but again, I will reiterate as I do often, as we did in the DHH episode, what's also incredible is the implementation of the infrastructure, how the thing is built. The legendary, well-documented Black Friday, I believe, in 2021, Shopify handled 30 terabytes of data every minute, 32 plus million requests per minute hit the servers, 11 million MySQL queries per second were processed. And all of that, mostly Ruby on Rails, the very framework, the very programming language that's not supposed to scale. And it did and it did so incredibly well seamlessly and still maintain the beauty underlying that implementation. There's this writeup I recently read about how they were actually able to make that happen. There's so many interesting details, including the fact that as DHH talked about, that it was a modular monolith and it was scaled horizontally in these very interesting modular ways. Again, that's probably outside of the scope of what I'm supposed to be doing here. Just another chance to celebrate the incredible engineering behind Shopify and all of that to help you sell stuff, you can sign up for a $1 per month trial period at Shopify dot com slash LEX.

This episode is also brought to you by Better Help spelled HELP, help they figure out what you need and match it with a licensed therapist in under 48 hours. And boy, in this episode do we delve into the dark aspects of human nature and the human mind. It is so fascinating and what's also I think, inspiring to me about Julia's work is that she approaches every situation, every human being with a deep empathy, realizing that each of us have the capacity for good and evil, and so much of who we are is shaped by our environment. That's a real honest way to deal with cases where humans do horrible stuff to each other, realizing that they're not somehow different than us, that we too, all of us are capable of doing these kinds of things. And when you think of it that way, you can more honestly and rigorously analyze why people do what they do. And yes, it is a reminder how complicated the human mind is. You can explore that human mind with the help of a licensed therapist and better help. It's easy, discrete, affordable, available worldwide.

I'm currently drinking it even though I'm traveling, it is always watermelon salt. I love it. Also, it's not just the OG drink mix. They got the sparkling water version. That is another form factor that's super delicious, much harder to travel with, but if you're at home and you can order a bunch, it's a delicious different way of consuming element. Again, it's a source of happiness. It makes me feel at home, even when I'm traveling. I'm still, and for the past many, many years, probably over a decade, maybe over 15 years, most days I'm doing one meal a day. I'm doing extremely low carb, not for any reasons except it makes me happy. But when you do that kind of stuff, you wanna make sure that the electrolytes are on point and I use the elements for that.

A G one does a simple thing and it does it well and makes sure that all your nutritional basis are covered. I make an a G one drink, I throw it in the freezer for like 10 minutes, 20 minutes, so it's nice and super cold and I drink it after a long run. Sit back, think about the universe and my place in it and it's become a little ritual that brings joy, joy to my life. Although today it's pouring outside. So I was about to go for a run and then drink in a one, but I think I'm gonna have to skip the run unless I'm insane, which I am. But no matter what, I'll drink in a one in a little bit here. Some of my happiest long distance runs have been when it starts pouring all of a sudden and at first there's a resistance, maybe I should find some cover. And then you just say, screw it. I just accept the fact that you're going to be soaking wet and especially if the rain is at all warm, it's just becomes this experience where you are truly one with nature and kind of stop giving a damn about the conventional experience of comfort and you're just there alive in the moment. It's a, it's a great, great experience. So now I just talk myself into screw it. I'm gonna go for a run anyway, they'll give you a one month supply of fish oil when you sign up@drinkagone.com slash LEX. This is LEX Friedman podcast to support it. Please Check out our sponsors in the description where you can also find LINKS to contact me, ask questions, get feedback, and so on. And now, dear your friends, here's Julia Shaw. You wrote the book Evil, the Size Behind Humanity's Dark Side. So lots of interesting topics to cover here. Let's start with the continuum. You described that evil is a continuum. In other words, the Dark Tetrad Psychopathy, you see it as a Narcissism. Machiavellianism are a continuum of traits, not a binary zero one label of monster or non monster. So can you explain this continuum?"

          "value": "2 (8m 43s):\nYeah, so each trait on the Dark Tetrad as it's called, which is the four traits that are associated with dark personality traits. So things that we often associate with the word evil like Sadism, which is a pleasure in hurting other people. Machiavellianism, which is doing whatever it takes to get ahead Narcissism, which is taking too much pleasure in yourself and seeing yourself as superior to others. And then there's Psychopathy, psychopathic personality specifically often lacks in empathy and it's usually characterized by a number of different traits including a parasitic lifestyle, so mooching off of others, deceptiveness lying to people. And again, that empathy dimension where you are more comfortable hurting other people because you don't feel sad when other people feel sad. Now, all of those traits, Psychopathy, Sadism, Machiavellianism and Narcissism, all of them have a scale. And so you can be low on each of those traits or you can be high on each of those traits. And what the Dark Tetrad is, it's actually a way of classifying people into those who might be more likely to engage in risky behaviors or harmful behaviors and those who are not. And if you score high on all of them, you're most likely to harm other people. But each of us score somewhere. So I might score score low on Sadism, but higher on Narcissism. And in all of them I'm probably subclinical. And so this is the other thing we often talk about in psychology is that there's clinical traits and clinical diagnoses, like someone is diagnosed as having Narcissism or there's subclinical, which is you don't quite meet the threshold, but you have traits that are related and that are so important for us to understand in the same context."

And so the question of would you kill baby Hitler is sort of a meant to be something that gets people chatting about whether or not they think that people are born with the traits that make them capable of extreme harm towards others or whether they think it's socialized, whether it's something that maybe in how people are raised is sort of manifests over time. And with Hitler, we know from certainly psychologists who have poured over his traits over time and looked at who he was over the course of his life, there's always this question of sort of was he mad or bad? And with the answer to was he mad? Well, he certainly had some characteristics that people would associate with, for example, maybe Sadism with this idea that he was less high on empathy is probably also showcased in his work. But in terms of whether he was born that way, I think the answer usually would be no. And actually in his early life he didn't showcase quite a lot of the traits that later he sort of defined the horrors that he was capable of. So would I go back in time and kill Bbe Hitler? The answer is no, because I don't think it's a straight line from baby to adult and I don't think people are born evil."

So for me that word is it's the end of a conversation. It's when we call somebody evil, we say, this person is so different from me that I don't even need to bother trying to understand why they are capable of doing terrible things because I would never do such things. I am good. And so that artificial differentiation between good and evil is something that certainly with the book I'm trying to dismantle. And that's why introducing continuums for different kinds of negative traits is really important. And introducing this idea that the, there's nothing fundamental to people that makes them capable of great harm. We all have the capacity to kill people and murder people and do other terrible things. The question is why we don't do those things rather than why we do do those things quite often. So I think humanizing and understanding that we all have these traits is the most important thing in, in my book certainly."

And so it's this fight of us versus them. And so you need both of those things. You need that sort of collapse of empathy for other people, the people who are on the other side. And you need this idea that you can be swallowed by the group and that gives you a sense of also the cloak of justice, the cloak of morality, even when you know maybe you're on the wrong side. And, and that's where, I mean, getting into sort of who's on the right side of each war is always a more complicated issue. But certainly calling other people evil and calling the other side evil and dehumanizing them is is crucial to most of these kinds of fights."

Also the title of my book is Evil or in the UK Market It's Making Evil, which is a reference to a nietzche quote, which is thinking evil is making evil. The idea being that evil is a label we place onto others. There's nothing inherent to anything that makes it evil. And so I also think that we need to, well dismantle that and empathize with people we call evil because if we're saying that this is the worst kind of act or worst kind of manifestation of what somebody can be. So if someone can destroy others, torture others hurt others, I work as a criminal psychologist, I work a lot on sexual abuse cases, on rape cases, on murder trials. And so in those contexts that word evil is used all the time to go, this person is evil. And if we're doing that, then we need to go, okay. But what we actually want is we don't really just wanna label people, we wanna stop that behavior from happening. And the only way we're gonna do that is if we understand what led that person to come to that situation and to engage in that behavior. And so that's why evil empathy I think is crucial because ultimately what we want is to make society safer. And the only way we can do that is to understand the psychological and social levers that led them to engage in this behavior in the first place."

I mean, I also speak with people who I think are, or have, I know have committed terrible crimes and I have spoken to these people because as a criminal psychologist, that's often part of my job. So what's interesting I think when you're speaking to people who have committed really terrible crimes or certainly who've been convicted of terrible crimes, is that not only is it potentially insightful because they might give you a real answer and not just a controlled narrative about why they committed these crimes. If they are either maintaining their innocence or they're more reluctant to do that, I think even the narrative that they are controlling that they're being very careful with still tells us a lot about them. So I think certainly in my research on environmental crime as well, what we see is that people use a lot of rationalization and they say things like, well, everybody's doing it. And if I hadn't done this first, somebody else would've done this waste crime or this other kind of crime. And so there's this rationalization, there's this normalization, there's this diminishing of your own role and agency. And that still tells us a lot about the psychology of people who commit crimes because most of us are very bad at saying sorry and saying, I messed this up and I shouldn't have done that. And instead what our brains do is they try to make us feel better and they go, no, you're still a good person despite this one thing. And so we try to rationalize it and we try to excuse it, we try to explain it and there is some truth to it as well because we know the reasons why we engage in that behavior and other people don't have the whole context. So we also do have more of the whole story. But on the other hand, we need to also face the fact that sometimes we do terrible things and we need to stop doing those terrible things and prevent other people from doing the same."

So I think looking at historical photos of children or sometimes even kids in other cultures, it's like, oh, why are they all so serious? Yeah, but our creepiness radars are also way off. So this is something that I've been interested in for a long time as well, is that we have this intuitive perception of whether or not somebody is trustworthy. And that intuitive perception according to ample studies at this point is not to be trusted. And one thing in particular is whether or not we think someone is creepy, including children. But usually the research is done of course on adult faces and with adults. And there's only recently did we even really define what that vague feeling of creepiness is creep. And it has a lot to do with just not following social norms. And this is something we see that transfers to other contexts like why people are afraid of people with severe mental illness and psychosis. If you're on the the bus or the tube in London and someone's talking to themselves and they're acting in an erratic way, we know that people are more like to keep a distance. There was one study where they literally had a waiting room where they also had people with chairs. And the question was, how many chairs would you sit away from someone you know has a severe mental illness? And the answer is you sit more chairs away and there's a physical and psychological distancing that's happening there. And it's not because people with severe mental illness are inherently more violent or more dangerous. That is not actually what the research finds. It's that we perceive them as such because we perceive them as weird. Basically we go, this isn't how you're supposed to be behaving. And so I'm worried about this and so I'm going to keep my distance. And so creepiness is much the same and that's where you can totally misfire whom you perceive as creepy just because they're not acting in the way that you expect people to act in society."

And we also don't trust people potentially who are too attractive, but again, deviation from the norm. And so if you're deviating in any way that can lead to, well your, your assessment being more wrong, but also you assessing people as more negative. And so with yeah, but with creepiness, the, the main thing that bothers me as a criminal psychologist is that tangential to creepiness is this general idea of trustworthiness and that you can tell whether somebody is lying. And I've done research on this as have lots of other people like Fry is one of the leading researchers on deception detection. And he has found in so many studies that it's really hard to detect whether someone is lying reliably and that people, especially police officers, people who do investigative interviewing, they have this high confidence level that they, because of their vast experience, can in fact tell whether the person across from them is lying to them, this witness, this suspect. And the answer to that, even that if you take them into experimental settings, they are no better than chance at detecting lies and yet they think they are. And so again, you get into this path where you're going to miss people who are actually lying to you potentially. And you're going to potentially point at innocent people and say, I think you're guilty of this crime. And you go hard on that person in a way that might even lead to a wrongful conviction."

There's also some research specifically on sort of faking good in, for example, parole decisions. So when it comes up to someone who is, there's a legal decision to be made as to whether this person's gonna be released from prison or released from just detention in general. And then the person will act in a particular way, sort of mimic a good prisoner, mimic someone who's safe to be released into society. And then the committee goes, oh well you know this, this person's doing great and so they're ready to to be released and then they make the wrong decision because that person's been faking it. So I think with Psychopathy it's a bit complicated. It's, there has been some sort of historically as well some concern that certain treatment for Psychopathy, especially empathy focused treatment, makes people with Psychopathy more likely to fake empathy and to weaponize it. But then there's other research which finds that if you use other kinds of interventions, it's like Jennifer scheme in California who does research on people with Psychopathy who have committed severe crimes. And she specifically creates these treatment programs that aren't just around empathy, but they're more around almost learning the rules of society and convincing people that actually being pro-social is a better way to get what you want in life. And so there's, there's a real need for tailored treatments to deal with, especially certain kinds of personality traits, dark personality traits to try and convince people basically actually being pro-social is the better path rather than just going hard on, you know, empathy and things that they don't maybe also see as faults with themselves."

So a lot of the nietzche quotes I use as well are, some of them I like because they speak to the chapters I write about but, and the issues I write about. But some of them I also like because they are how people think about evil and people who are labeled evil. And I do think with gazing into the abyss and the abyss back, it's more of a, you're trying to find it and, and that's why in some ways that doesn't work actually because it isn't a total blank, it isn't the abyss. There are in fact things that you can see even, even if it's just superficially and patterns you can recognize to help you and key decision makers, especially in legal settings, make better decisions around people like this. So when they see these patterns, they act a better way. So yeah, I I, I get asked a lot as a criminal psychologist, do you carry the cases that you deal around with you? So some of the cases involve, you know, huge amounts of witnesses, huge amounts of potential wit victims. And so in these cases there are very visceral descriptions sometimes of heinous crimes. And I think that as someone who does this work, you can't be someone who sees it as anything other than a puzzle. So you have to look at it and go, here's the different pieces of information. What I am doing is pattern recognition. I'm not here to emotionally invest in each of these victims or potential victims. That's not my role. There's therapists for that. There's other people who do that work. I am here working with the police, I'm here working with lawyers, I'm here looking at it more sort of objectively to see how this all fits together. And so I think that's how I engage with it. I see it as this, this puzzle that I'm trying to figure out."

And I think sometimes scientists read us callous because we enjoy this discovery of knowledge and the discovery of insights and it just feels like this little light bulb has gone off and you go, oh, I understand a tiny bit more about the human experience or about the world around us. And I think it must be similar. I don't, I don't know that I feel or worry that I sort of become more quote unquote evil. I think it's more that you add this nuance, which I guess sometimes can be estranging to other people. So there's that. So when you speak with others, sometimes like even when I say we shouldn't use the word evil, people go, no, but you have to. Does that mean you're trivializing things? And the answer is no, I'm not trivializing. I'm just trying to understand also like sympathizing or being empathetic towards people whom others have written off is always going to get that response from some people. And I mean there are real questions around whom we're platforming and what that has and what role we have as content creators. Both of us, of the people we talk about how we cover them, I often come across this in true crime work that I do. 'cause I get asked to do TV shows, I host TV shows and I host BBC podcasts. And there's always the question of sometimes people commit murder to become famous and should it be a blanket ban that we don't cover those cases or should we cover those cases but in a different way or should we anonymize the, so there's, it doesn't mean that you shouldn't never cover that case. It just means that you need to think about it."

And just to be clear, bad people, much like the title Evil is sort of tongue in cheek where the idea is it's people whom we refer to as bad people. And then it's always a question of like who are these quote unquote bad people? And are we all capable of doing these terrible things? But one of the most certainly problematic dark cases that we covered was the Robert Pickton case and the episodes are called Piggy's Palace because that was the nickname for the farm where Robert Pickton brought victims whom he had kidnapped and then he killed them and he did terrible things to their bodies. And rumors have it certainly that he fed some of these victims to pigs. Now, one of the reasons I covered that case is actually because it was influential in my own career. So Robert Pickton is one of the most famous Canadian Serial Killers of all time. And as I was doing my undergrad at Simon Fraser University in Canada, I was being taught by someone called Stephen Hart. And Stephen Hart was an expert witness on the Robert Pickton trial. And so he was keeping us abreast of some of the developments of what he was covering. And it, I found it so interesting and I loved Stephen Hart as a person and he seemed to have this sense of humor, this gallows humor around it all, despite being faced with one of the arguably worst people in Canadian history. And I thought that that was so interesting that someone could be so nice and so kind and so wonderful and be an expert witness for these kinds of people. And so that's one of the reasons I went into the field is because of this case as well. And so we had him on the show, so he came on to bad people and we interviewed him for it."

She was in the press and so she has worked with lawyers to educate the court on memory in lots of really, really controversial cases. But the way she would explain it is that it's still her role to just train people and teach people on how memory works. She's not there to decide whether people are guilty or innocent, but she is there to help people distinguish between fact and fiction when it comes to how our memories work or don't."

And this is something we see with a lot of Serial Killers is that they have this loneliness, which I think also not only contributes to them committing the crimes in the first place, but also allows them to get away with things because they don't have as much of a social network or any social network that is helping them to do what's called a monitoring to understand what's true and what's not. And so when you see people get radicalized in their own thoughts, whether that's in sense in the sense of things like schizophrenia, where you've got psychosis, you've got delusions, maybe command hallucinations, that's when you think you're hearing voices and someone is telling you that you have to do something, usually something harmful to other people. And if you don't follow those, you will hear those voices forever. They're profoundly distressing and they're one of the aspects of schizophrenia that if you have it does make you more prone to violence. And so for these kinds of cases, if you don't have someone intervening, whether that's a family member or a therapist saying how, how can you tell whether this thought is real? Maybe that thought, maybe you're not hearing that voice right? Maybe that aspect of what you're thinking isn't true and bring you back and closer to reality. You can just wander off to whatever alternate universe that you might live in in your head. And it's the same with radicalization in other contexts is that you see that people who drift more and more into a certain group that has certain beliefs that are maybe divorced from the evidence, divorced from reality, you can see that people will get more extreme over time. And unless you have a tether that brings you back, that allows you to do reality monitoring, it's gonna be very difficult to to find your way out of that. So with Serial killers, we find this reality monitoring problem, and I think part of that's related to the lack of social networks that people have."

There's something in that where I can't help but go, that's so sad. I don't go, oh my God, how terrible. How awful. And of course it's atrocious, of course it's heinous.

And one of the reasons I think that is because you can see neighbors turning on each other, especially if you look historically at the start of wars or big political moments where you have people who would've called each other friends turning each other into the police, killing each other, doing terrible things. So I think all it takes is to become convinced that the people you think are your friends are actually your enemies, whether that's just in your own world or in a larger political national landscape that I think, I don't think it takes all that much for us to be capable of doing terrible things, but that's also why it's really important when things are good and when you're not at war and when you have the capacity to think deeply about important issues to train your mind on these thoughts of knowing that things like loneliness can manifest in these extreme ways that things like Jealousy and aggression, that they can turn into murder, that they can turn into these horrible versions and to then also spot the red flags if you start going down that path. I think if we don't rehearse evil, if you will, we are much more likely to engage in it, especially in those moments where we don't have much time or energy to really think about what we're doing."

And most women as well, more than 50% of women have fantasized about killing somebody. So murder fantasies are incredibly common and certainly according to some researchers, that's a good thing. Being able to rehearse and think through doing the most terrible things is it's a great dress rehearsal for also how we don't want to live our lives. And only if you are able to fully think through what would I actually be like if I was engaging in this, what would I be thinking? Who would I be with? What would be my, the group that I am charging against this other person, you know, who, who am I there with? As you said, like really putting yourself in the shoes of these people who've done terrible things. That is how you also realize that you do not want those consequences. And so yeah, you maybe wanna murder this person, but you don't really wanna murder this person that's that intuitive sort of animalistic brain coming in. But then luckily we have higher reasoning that goes, actually, if you think this through, that's a pretty terrible consequence for yourself. So the better thing to do is not to murder this person. So I think it's adaptive to be able to fantasize and think about these things. Obviously if you start getting to a point where you're ruminating and you're going these circles where you're constantly fantasizing about doing dark things, especially to a specific person, I'd always advise seeing somebody to talk to like a psychologist for example, because that then does become a risk factor for acting on those dark fantasies. But up to that point, if it's just a fleeting thought or something that sort of in in one day you have these thoughts, that is totally healthy, I would say."

          "value": "2 (39m 57s):\nYeah. So it's also been called the heroic imagination. So someone who has studied evil quote unquote at length, it's called Philip Zimbardo. He did the Stanford Prison Experiment. And that was an experiment, which is, I mean it's now been torn apart in various ways. It was absolutely influential for psychology. It's where participants were randomly assigned whether they would be prisoners or guards in a mock prison experiment. And then for a number of days they were told to do various things and it got outta control and the guards went way over what they were supposed to be doing, and they effectively started pseudo torturing some of these inmates or these pretend inmates. And the whole thing had to be stopped prematurely. But it was really fundamental in showing how just by randomly being assigned into guard the person in charge or inmate, you can within a matter of days, have a completely different way of thinking about one another. And so Philip Lombardo has also spoken at length about evil and that all of us are capable of it in the right circumstances, but he also is a big proponent of what he calls the heroic imagination. And the heroic imagination is really what the purpose of everything I do is the purpose of what I do isn't just to go, Ooh, this is curious and to stop there. The point is to then prevent it and to prevent it in ourselves because that's, I think ultimately what has to happen. You can't do a top down sort of government level approach to trying to be so tough on crime that no one will ever commit crime. That's impossible. But you can change, sort to say it in an attacky way, the hearts and minds of individuals to recognize the pathways towards evil and to go, wait, I'm, I'm off track. I don't wanna go this way and I'm gonna stop myself here and here's how I can find my way back. And so the heroic imagination is exercising that I, I see someone on the street, how do I make sure that they're okay? How do I not become a bystander? And actually the bystander stuff is interesting because there was a really famous case, the murder of Kadi Gena, and there were all of these both ear and eyewitnesses. So an ear witness is someone who just hears things. And an eyewitness is someone who sees the crime happening and they didn't intervene in the murder of this woman. And so this case was often taken as this almost example of, look how terrible human beings are. We just walk by, we don't care about what's happening to strangers on the streets. And actually what's happened since is that there's been lots of other bystander experiments and they have not substantiated this. So we need to be very careful with looking at these extreme cases and going, how horrible that this happened to this one person. And it is, but that doesn't mean that that's always how it happens. And so actually what we find in bystander research is that most of the time bystanders do intervene. It's just when there has already been a crowd that has accumulated, you read the room and you assume, well, nobody else has intervened yet. And so it must not be a real problem. That desire to not stand out in a negative way is often what hinders heroism. I mean that's why we look at heroes, people who especially risk their own lives to save others, especially strangers. We see them with a sort of respect that nobody else gets. And that's because we recognize that we might not be capable of that. If I saw a stranger drowning in a river, would I really risk my life get jumping in the river to maybe save them? Ah, it's, I think that's a big question mark. And so when people do that, especially when people almost have this inherent reaction that they just jump in, they just go for it. That is something that is a really admirable quality and that we as humans do celebrate and we should. And I think often we should celebrate those incidents more and not the, you know, the bystander moments where we didn't inter intervene. We should be normalizing. Intervening."

          "value": "2 (44m 21s):\nMurder is a really interesting crime because most of the time it's perpetrated for reasons that we don't like as a society. So as a person who talks a lot to the news and also to producers who are trying to make true crime shows who don't necessarily have a deep understanding of psychology, let's just say, and who come at you with myths where you go, oh no, we're not, we're not gonna talk about that. We're not gonna talk about whether or not the mom is to blame for this person killing somebody. I hate that ex. That's one of my, my least favorite sort of the trauma narrative of all people who do terrible things must have had a terrible childhood, I think is really problematic. What really happens in murder most of the time, which is not what you see on TV because it's really boring, is it's a fight that gets out of control. And if you look at the real reasons stated, it's things like, this person owed me $4 and so I killed him. This person stole my bike, this person, I mean, it's these really stupid reasons and it is just this bad decision in the moment, an overreaction to a fight, to an argument. And it wasn't planned. It's not some psychopath sharpening their knives waiting for months to try and kill this person. And we don't like that because there's something called the victimization gap, which is that the impact of this extreme situation on the perpetrator, there's a huge gap between that and the impact on the victim and their family. So the victim loses the life, whereas the perpetrator, sure they get imprisoned, but that at best, right, if you will, in terms of justice. But they don't have the same kinds of consequences. And we don't like that. We like things that have extreme consequences to have extreme reasons. And so that's why I think there's this real desire to show Serial Killers and to show people who are in fact planning murders for a really long time and then engage in them rather than this fight that goes outta control or someone drink driving or someone who is, I mean unfortunately intimate partner homicide is also one of those situations that is common, one of the top four reasons for murder as well. But that's not the almost glamorized version that we see of murder online or that we see in the news. So I think it's always important to talk about murder as something that is rarely inherent to an individual. Very few people want to murder. They might fantasize about it, but they don't wanna go through with it. And very few people who do engage in murder wanted to do it in that instance. Nevermind again. I think in general we have the way that we look at lots of crimes upside down. So we put murderers in prison for a really long time because we think that that's justice, which is, sure, that's one version where it's an eye for an eye kind of, you know, life for life. There's obviously the more extreme version of that, which is the death penalty, which I don't adhere to, but I could see the rationalization of you, you stole somebody else's life, so you don't deserve to have one. But there's also the other side, which is if we're looking at prevention, murder is really like they're not gonna, people aren't gonna go out and murder again. So that is, that's a really low risk in terms of recidivism actually. And high risk are things like fraud and elder abuse and sexual violence. And so in some ways, sometimes our sanctions are upside down in terms of how we can actually make society safer and they're in line more just with how we perceive justice to work. So there's, there's big fundamental questions about how we organize our justice systems and what we want 'em to be for."

          "value": "2 (48m 6s):\nI think forgiveness is up to the victim's families. And quite often when you speak with victims' families, there is this divide where you have some who are much more keen on something called restorative justice, which is where they, what they want is for the person to apologize, the perpetrator, to apologize, to explain how it happened. Also, quite often, I mean you look at the, some of the other consequences in the other context, it's sort of like teenage boys who are part of gangs, for example, is the other context, and it's a teenage boy killing another teenage boy. Like these are kids and the parents of a teenage boy understand that this isn't, you know, they don't think of this other perpetrator as this grown man who has, I don't know it, I think we think of it as this fight between the parents of both teenage boys in that case. But really often what parents want is to just understand how this could happen and in some ways to allow the other teenage boy to still have a life and to not steal theirs as well, or his as well. So there's that restorative justice model where forgiveness, I think, belongs to the families. Some families, of course want the most extreme punishment. That's also, I can understand how that would be a, a response that's triggered if you've suffered a severe loss. But if we're looking to make society safer, putting people who've killed in prison is actually not the answer, right? Because if we want society to be safer, it should be based purely on what is most likely to deter crime and who is most likely to engage in it. And that's where I think we've got it upside down."

And so, and, and the idea of entitlements. So I think one thing that we see often in crimes of all sorts actually is the sense of entitlement that drives the perception that I'm allowed to engage in X because of something else, and I deserve to have a life that looks like this, but I don't. And so I'm going to go take it or I'm going to go do something to show my dissatisfaction in life. And so if you think that all men deserve to have a happy life, sort of a Disney version with with a woman at home who's taking care of the kids, and this this sort of white picket fence ideal that we've been sold, we haven't been told that that is what we should have. Like I, I understand where it comes from, and the question though is are we entitled to that or is that the idea that that's something we should strive towards? And I think the answer is no. Nobody's entitled to a good life. I would like to see freedoms and rights manifest in such a way that everyone is able to achieve the kind of life that they themselves want, but you're not entitled to it. And so that's where I think it can get a bit crossed and we can be sold these lies that are basically impossible for everybody in society to achieve. And and understandably people get angry. And if you're angry and if you feel entitled, and if you're in this group where everyone else is thinking the same way as you, yeah, that can make you dangerous."

          "value": "2 (51m 59s):\nSo Tinder Swindler, that was a person who pretended on Tinder to be a rich guy who had this lavish lifestyle, and he would match with women on Tinder and very quickly love bombed them. So he would send them all kinds of messages and immediately start being very emotional, very sharing, pretend that he is messaging from his private jet or actually messaged from his private jet, but pretend that he's in love with this person very quickly. And then he would invite women, in this case, Cecilia, to very expensive luxurious dates. So he would whisk them away to Paris, or he would show them his private jet, or he would take them to a really expensive restaurant almost to prove that he in fact is this really wealthy guy. And he would simultaneously be building up the story of a future together. And you see this in people who are really problematic in relationships in a lot of ways. I mean, this is not just in scams or in criminal settings, but problematic relationship styles often involve someone who is creating this idea of a future together that you can just see it now, you know, our kids in the garden running around you are the only one for me. That kind of language, like almost planning your wedding on the third date, that kind of thing is what he would weaponize. And she, Cecilia Wa was looking for love. She wanted all of those things. And so it worked really well. And what he ended up doing is defrauding her of lots of money and she ended up taking out loans and her family were giving her money to help. What he was saying was this critical situation, very classic fraud, it's critical situation where he was being followed, he was under attack and he needed her to pay for some things. He needed her to pay for some flights until she ran outta money. And then, then, then she realized that this all was a big fraud. This was a, a love scam. So the reason that we spoke with her is partly to show how it can happen. And I think it's really important to remind people that this is something everybody is capable of believing fraud works because people know what we wanna hear and they tell us the things we wanna hear. And so I think all of us, there's a tailored version of fraud that could appeal to basically everybody if they have enough information about you."

I would know if someone's trying to scam me of money until it happens to us. And then we go, oh, wait, that, that, that did just happen. And then we get really embarrassed. And so I think talking about it's really important and seeing it's not the thing that happens to dumb people because that is sometimes how it's framed as like, us such an idiot. She was so gullible.

But the problem is if that person then starts to weaponize the fact that they're controlling the finances and starts using words like, I'm gonna give you your allowance, instead of going, you've paid as much into this as I have. And so this is our shared money and starts using that and controlling things and controlling how the other person lives in that relationship. That's when you get into things that are called course of control and things like Jealousy can also be used in that way."

And I personally think that Jealousy is basically always a red flag because what it means is that the person who is jealous isn't secure in the relationship. And the reason that they're not secure in the relationship is either because the relationship is wrong for them or because they are insecure in themselves. And I don't think it is a sign of love. I don't think it is a sign of, you know, you wanna protect your mate. I think it is mostly control and it's the desire to control and to possess. And Jealousy we know is a precursor to intimate partner violence almost always, as in not all Jealousy leads to violence of course, but all violence is the Jealousy is a precursor. And quite a lot of that is imagined things that the, the partner is doing, not even based on reality. That we go back to our deception detection research where we're bad at telling whether someone's lying or not. And so if you're basing how you're interacting with that person on a faulty lie detector, you're gonna make bad decisions. So the research also bears out that most people are really bad at Monogamy. So most people either have cheated on a significant other, maybe not their current, significant other, but a significant other or have cheated multiple times. And that's, that's just consistently found in the research."

And I think that at least based on the research on how people actually behave, they're not actually behaving in a monogamous way. If you're cheating on your partner, that is not Monogamy, that is polyamory potentially. So the love of multiple people and it's lying and it, and it's, it doesn't have to be that way. So I'm polyamorous and I, I believe that you can love multiple people. I don't know that everyone is always going to meet lots of people at the same time that they're gonna love. But I think that there's been a move towards more people embracing open relationships and non-traditional relationship structures. And I think that is healthy to at least have as an option. I think the idea that there's this one size fits all for relationships is really harmful to a lot of people and it just doesn't really work for everybody. Well,"

So I'm bi has also found that people who are bi are more likely to be in non-traditional relationships. And one of the reasons for that is probably also because we constantly get asked, justify our Sexuality as well. And so if constantly you're being asked if one person's enough for you, if one gender's enough for you, if you're in a relationship with one person, for example, you know, if I'm in a relationship with a man, do you, do you miss women? And it's like, I don't ask you that. If you're in a relationship with a woman, do you miss women? Like you probably do, but that's just other women than you're partner. It has nothing to do with being bi. And so I think there's this constant barrage of questions of what does it mean? Is it real? How do you choose? What does a relationship look like? Do you constantly want threesomes? Like there's this constant hypersexualization also, especially of women that we find in the research that can also lead to really negative outcomes for mental health and for things like risk of sexual violence. But on the other hand, you've got bisexual people themselves saying, yeah, but I feel like I also have the superpower that I can love more widely and gender doesn't really matter in terms of whom I'm capable of loving. And so relationship structures almost come with that conversation. It's not that we need to be non-monogamous or that we need to be in these kinds of relationships. It's more that I think if you've engaged so deeply with your Sexuality, partly 'cause society's forced you to, then you're also gonna be thinking about relationship structures more generally and going, actually I'm gonna choose this one. Yeah,"

And I did that after I created a bisexual research group. So I wasn't a Sexuality researcher, but as a bi person and a scientist, I was interested in the science of bisexuality and I couldn't really find it, it was really hard to figure out what people were actually learning about bisexual people in comparison to other kinds of queer people. And one of the things I've found is that the terms that are used are not necessarily bi. And so it could be things like blurry sexual. So if you type into Google scholar the word bisexual, you're gonna get a lot of confusing things also because bisexual is used for like two sexes or you have multiple sex or you can change. And so they're, they're bisexual, right? Yeah. Which is different entirely. And so I think partly out of that, researchers started using words like pl sexual and omnisexual is another one. And so if you're looking for research on this, pl sexual is probably the word, but what"

          "value": "2 (67m 15s):\nThe biggest thing that researchers find people misunderstand about bisexuality is that it's a phase and that it's this idea that it's transient, that it's always changing and that it's a stepping stone. So I think a lot of people still see bisexuality as on the way to gay town, sort of like you're, you're on your way but you haven't quite committed and you're still stuck in expectations of society. You haven't quite let go yet, but really you're gay. And that's especially true for men. And so when you look at research on bisexual men, which is actually how the research started. So I think now when we think of bisexuality, we think of women, and it's true that today twice as many women identify as bisexual as men. But if you look at the history of this and the research on bisexuality over time, it was the other way around. So someone called Alfred Kinsey was one of the first Sexuality researchers in recent history, certainly. And he, after World War II, did this really big study of sexual behavior in the human male. It was called, he was a biologist himself. And so he thought in taxonomies and he was doing research on gall wasps, so insects and this idea of human Sexuality was sort of thrown at him after the war because there's also this whole move to get people to well reproduce and to rebuild America. And so Sexuality was partly, and sex specifically was becoming more of an area of interest, both in terms of research and in terms of policy and funding. And so Alfred Kinsey was asked, do you want to do a class on human sexual behavior? And he was like, I know nothing about this. And so he spent about a year just listening to students' questions about like what they wanna know about sex. And he realized that he was looking for research to try and build up this course that he was probably going to teach. And he realized that he couldn't answer most of their questions because the research hadn't been done. And so a lot of the questions were around what is normal? You know, if I feel this during sex, is that normal? How often do people have sex? Should I want these? What about these fantasies? What does it mean? What if I have homosexual fantasies? What if I engage in this kind of, and so he was looking at all of these questions and collating them. And then he went out and did these huge studies and he interviewed thousands of people himself, but also had all these research assistants who were out there interviewing people in America about their sexual behavior, which I mean, just picture the time. It's like the 1940s. This is quite a conservative time. I mean certainly more than we might expect now. And here's this researcher asking incredibly personal questions about thousands and thousands and thousands of people. And he ended up finding, and this is one of the big findings in this book that he published called Sexual Behavior in the Human Male, which was a best seller for an entire year. He sold out auditoriums, they had to sometimes add the room next to the room he was in because there was so much desire, huh? To Go to his lectures about sex that they had to like connect radios to other halls to give people enough space to sit down. He was basically a rock star. And again, I think this challenge is a misconception we have about Sexuality that we think of it as this sort of woke thing now that the rainbow flag and all this stuff is sort of this, this modern invention almost. But if you, that's, this is the forties this was happening, people were going to these talks, people were having these conversations and he created something called the Kinsey Scale. And so the Kinsey scale is from zero to six. And he found that it was not useful to apply a binary to people's sexual desires and sexual orientation. It was more useful to put them on a continuum because most people were not exclusively homosexual or exclusively heterosexual. Most people were somewhere in between. And so, so zero was exclusively heterosexual tendencies and six was exclusively homosexual. And he would place people based on all the things they told him somewhere on the scale. And about half of men were somewhere in the middle, not exclusively either. And about a quarter of women. Now think about the time,"

So there's something called a homosocial environment, which has nothing to do with being gay that has to do with being in a situation where you are with people of the same gender as you. So a homosocial environment or things like prisons where you only have men or only have women war, which at that point they just had. And so you have a lot of men who are exclusively in the company of men and maybe looking around going, well now that my options are different, maybe I'm gonna choose from this pool. Anyway, so he found that it was that way around that a lot of people have these fantasies or or actions that they've engaged in. And then there were other researchers, other male researchers who found similar things. And then at some point in the seventies it swapped and it felt like maybe more people, more men were identifying as gay and there maybe less people who were, would've called themselves by. And suddenly this became a thing more for women. So I think that there's some social things going on, there's some research things going on, but actually bi men are have been studied for a long time as well."

And gay, what depends. So if they have what you might refer to as a homosexual lifestyle, so they engage in sort of going to queer parties, maybe go on Grindr or other gay apps, that would be much more a lifestyle thing where you've embraced and you, you see this part of your identity that you are part of this queer community. It's much easier to say you're gay than you are bi most often. Also because there's queer phobia within the queer community. And so you might get gay men saying to a biman, ah, come on, you're act i I was by once. That's a classic. I was by once or Come on, you're actually gay. It's the same that you get the other way around with bi woman. Is that because it's seen as performative, the idea being that bisexual women are doing it for attention, but the attention of men specifically that, well they're all gonna go back to men anyway and they're just doing it. It's a phase. It's this thing that they're doing actually to be sexy to men, not because they're actually interested in women. And so there's this lesbian bi thing going on which is often quite hostile, not always, but often. And there's this gay male bi thing that going on which is different in nature but is also potentially hostile. So in both saying you're bi can be, can be problematic, but for men more so"

          "value": "2 (74m 59s):\nThe Kinsey scale's a good start. And the Kline grid I think is much more fun in some ways. So the Klein grid came out of research by Alfred Kinsey and others like Havelock Ellis, but we won't get into him. And Fritz Klein was a male researcher doing research also on bisexuality. He was specifically a therapist and he was looking at people who were struggling with their Sexuality. And so people would show up in the seventies and eighties in his practice and they would say, I'm struggling with my Sexuality. And he would say, how can I help you? And they would say things like, I wish I wasn't interested in men and I'm a man. And he would then work through sort of what that means. Does that mean you don't wanna have these feelings? Does that mean that you don't wanna have these attractions? Does that mean that it's the, the implications of like how your friends and family will see you? That's the problem. And so he created this much more complex scale, which I think is really interesting for everybody to do no matter what their Sexual fetishes, because what it is is it gets you to think about things like, yeah, your sexual identity easy, but it not just that, but in past, present and ideal. And so if you say, well I used to identify as straight, now I identify as bisexual and then I have in my head, this doesn't mean that other people think this in my head, I have an ideal, which could be straight because that's what maybe society's told us we should be, but it could also be something else. And so I've also had friends who've gone, you know, past, present, straight, straight, but ideal bi. So you get into these interesting dynamics where sometimes people just wish they were different Sexuality than they were for other reasons. And then there's other things in the, in the scale that ask about your lifestyle. So for example, if you are in going to parties, queer parties, if you have queer friends, then you might have a homosexual lifestyle even if you're straight. But then again it's how, how would, how much lifestyle would you like? And so for me that was a real moment where I was looking at that going, wow, my lifestyle is really straight and maybe I need to change this. And so he was using these attractions and fantasies and identities and the past present ideal to help people to think through all these complicated feelings we have around our Sexuality and to identify problem like sticking points."

I think that there are, there's this tendency to assume that Sexual fetishes something that we find and keep and consolidate from our teenage years, maybe early twenties you maybe get university thrown in. So if you get your experimental years in undergrad, but then it, you kinda have to choose. And that is a difficult requirement I think for a lot of people because you can't possibly know all of the things and all the people you might be interested in at that point. And we change in every other way. Why wouldn't we change in this way? So I think giving ourselves also the ability to reappraise where we're at with our own Sexuality, our own desires, our own relationship status, all these things is important to keep us happy and healthy and to not run into issues that we know are faced by a lot of homosexual but also bisexual people. Like research has found that bisexual people are more likely to self harm, they're more likely to be the victims of sexual violence, more likely to be isolated, more likely to be stalked. There's lots of different aspects of being bi that are negative. And the reason for that is mostly because bi people are at least likely to be plugged into the community. So when you're going through stuff like this and you feel different and you're constantly being asked about your Sexuality, if you're open about it or you're hiding it, that's also troubling. You're gonna have these negative consequences, especially if you don't feel like the queer community is really a place for you. So that's where also finding your people really matters."

          "value": "2 (80m 44s):\nSo the reason I included kinks in evil and sexual conversations in general is because it is so often thrown into the same conversation. So if someone comes to me and says, Julia, I want you to help me explain why this person killed this other person. And they'll often say, did you know that he or she was also into insert kink here or insert non-traditional relationship structure here or insert whatever. And I respond to that by going, okay, so, and I think people use these words like, oh he was really into BDSM and think that that's going to have this really important impact on me. Or ooh, they were swingers. And so, and again I go, yeah, that that's you know, almost like, and in other news they were swingers. It's like that is not related to this crime at all unless, you know, one of the partners was killed. But people see this as a defective character and kink is very much seen as a defective character in many circles, especially in sort of broader society. And that is wild to me because if you look at research on sexual fantasies and kinks, a lot of people have at least one. So a lot of people, BDSM being the the most common are engaging in or interested in BDSM. So things like choking or things like restraints or being degraded or doing the degrading of other people in bed consensually of course that is something that a lot of people fantasize about and a lot of people engage in. And so these kinks and these fetishes, they are much more commonplace than we sometimes think about them as. Now on the other hand, we obviously need to be careful not to assume that because in pornography BDSM is almost ubiquitous. It feels that that means everybody wants this. That is absolutely not the case. But we also don't wanna marginalize it and say it's almost nobody. It's, it's somewhere in between. And the main thing is always just to ask and to have open conversations about what it is that people actually want in bed and to make sure you have things like safe wordss. So you know, putting in the restraints to make sure that these interactions are safe and consensual. And then being able to explore. And I mean there's everything from you know, pop play where you dress up as a puppy and you engage in either just general frolicking or sexual behavior to other things like blood play, which is when you pierce the skin to release some sort of blood that can be scratching, that can be cutting, that can be of yourself or your partner. That can be this idea of, you know, I don't know, it's this taboo thing you're doing together and it's sexy in its own way. And so everybody has their own versions of what they find attractive and rubbing up against people, you know, sort of unsuspecting pretending that someone's sleeping. There's, there's this wide range of things and I think people also feel often deeply ashamed about the things that they're interested in. And I think that is also really sad because it makes it more likely that people are going to not be able to live that part of themselves and also that they think there's something wrong with them. And that can spiral into things like am I evil? Am I bad? Am I a bad person? Because they have these fantasies and that ties in unfortunately with homosexuality and bisexuality and the way that certainly historically and in most parts of the world still today, these queer lives and queer identities are still villainized. They're still seen as lesser as bad as a sign of a defective character. And if people see that within themselves, they're going to think differently about themselves and we, well society is going to treat them differently. So it's all about de-stigmatizing."

And I really like that because it's freeing. And so that's that disinhibition hypothesis is that the reason that we often Go to things in the bedroom that in other contexts we don't like or even find repulsive. Like I don't in normal life potentially wanna be told what to do, but maybe when you move into the bedroom you go yeah, but this is a different context and I kind of want the reverse of what I want in my day-to-day life. And so I can also understand like furries and that's sort of completely living as another species of it even is. It's a really interesting psychological phenomenon of release and of letting go of social pressure."

I mean this is also why we like fiction because it allows you to maybe be somebody else, have someone else's thoughts in your mind for a while and you really get to live it as that for a bit. So I think, yeah, the truth in fiction sort of circle is always an interesting one."

And that's true whether it's about your Sexuality. So being gay and being unable to live as a gay person or if that's wanting to engage in BDSM and not having an outlet for that. So that can just make you unhappy. So I think that the, the stigma there is that that unhappiness is going to lead to some sort of horrible manifestations of crime. I think that is mostly nonsense, but it's more that I'm concerned about the mental health consequences for the individual who's unable to explore those sides of themselves. And in research on kinks and Sexuality, it's just about also making sure that we have visible representation of certain kinds of communities. And so that's one of the reasons I ended up writing bi. I came out and making evil, making evil's the UK Title Evil in the us. I came out because I was writing about all the things we associate with the word evil and homosexuality certainly is one of those things."

I came out as bisexual and I came out as bisexual in the book and I did it specifically and I wrote it this way as well because I was talking about the importance of visibility and how it's through visibility that you realize that the people around you, people you already know and love are part of this community that otherwise feels other. It feels foreign, it feels abstract and maybe it feels scary, but if you realize that actually you've got gay friends or you've got friends who are into certain kinds of fetishes or you've got friends who are whatever Sexuality sort of aspect you're talking about, you suddenly go, oh it's gonna be much harder to dehumanize these people. And, and this is where all of this kind of comes from me from a really sad place. There's the, you could talk about bi as this project of love and how I was finding the community. I was trying to write something that would sort of bring us all together. But it's also because I'm constantly terrified that my rights are going to be stripped back. And we know that the laws around homosexual behavior and the rights around bisexual people as well, they're in flux. There's no straight line of acceptance. And just because right now I happen to live in a time and place where I'm allowed to be openly bisexual and I can engage in homosexual activity, that doesn't mean that that's gonna stay, not even necessarily in my lifetime. And so I think much like writing evil at a time when you're not at war and you're able to think really prof, you know deeply about these important issues, I think we also need to be thinking about things like Sexuality and other issues that are important to us. And if we wanna preserve our rights, we need to normalize these issues and make sure that they're visible so that people find it harder to dehumanize those communities. And so I'm always terrified that bisexual people are gonna be hypersexualized dehumanized again and that there's gonna be laws against basically just who I am."

So it was really beautiful the the fan mail I got when the sort of responses to the book and they got them from all over the world. And so in the book I also spoke with some researchers who were in like stationed or doing research in countries where bisexual behavior specifically is illegal or homosexual behavior was illegal for a long time. Bisexuality was, especially in women, well actually homosexuality women in general was sort of seen as it was, it was a blind spot because what counted as sex is sex with a penis. And so women can't have sex with one another. And so a lot of laws around homosexuality are specifically applying to men. And certainly historically that's the case. So we're talking about like sodomy and that involves men and not women. And so if you look at the evolution of laws for a while women were kind of like, it was socially not necessarily acceptable, but they were kind of getting away with it legally. But then more recently, especially as bisexuality gets more visible as well, certain countries have started writing it specifically into their constitutions and specifically into their laws that bisexual identities and behaviors are also seen as problematic and illegal. So again, these laws change all the time, but in terms of fan mail, especially from people in countries where homosexuality and bisexuality are illegal or are seen as problematic or socially condemned, that was particularly important so that those people were particularly writing saying something, also saying, can I translate this into this other language on the dl, like on the down low And just like distribute this to my friends, I, I had people sending me messages saying I am at X airport or an X country where this is, this would be considered contraband. Like this book, my book is a banned book. Fun fact."

Books like mine but also other books might help you to navigate whether or not your, you know, what labels there are and also whether or not those labels are good for you. I think things like the client grid are really helpful, especially for people who are more analytically minded like you and I, I think it gives you a construct to work with and numbers to work with and that can be really helpful to try and go almost seeing your Sexuality as a mathematical equation. And I think that can be quite useful. And if that's how you think, then look at Thelan grid and see if that helps you to navigate things."

It was the first mainstream book on bisexuality ever. And BII don't think I would've been taken seriously as a scientist.

Which again is obviously something that then wove its way into my academic work. That's pretty cool. But he was also right, I mean I, I've always been very intellectual. Let's just say I skipped a couple of grades in school. I was part of the chess lab, like it was very much, I was the clever kid. And so, but there's also part of me that's just like, but art is beautiful. I love making art and it can speak to so many people. Anyway, my grandfather convinced me not to do it and then I applied instead for psychology. Although at that point you just had to say social sciences, you didn't have to yet spec specify. But I knew it was probably gonna be psychology. And the reason for that was because my dad has paranoid schizophrenia. And so I think one of the reasons I'm so obsessed with this idea of what is real and, and that is in every way that that, I mean that in terms of what is real in terms of perceptions of right and wrong. What is real in terms of our own memories of the world, what is real in terms of what happened in a crime, what is real in terms of perceptual abilities and neuroscience, what is real? I mean, I mean that on in every way. And I think that's because I grew up with someone who had a unique view of what is real in real time. And so seeing that I think just affected me profoundly because not only was it very destabilizing in terms of my upbringing, but also it's just in your face that people quite literally are seeing and hearing different things than you. And to not jump from that to what else are people perceiving differently than me, I think would be almost like a missed opportunity. And so I went to study psychology partly to understand that and what was going on there. And then that took me down the sort of reality hole. And honestly the reason I went to Criminal psychology because I could've gone into any other, the criminal psychologists were the most, they were the most fun. I feel like lots of psychologists, they took themselves so seriously and I just, I, I couldn't, I was like, I don't, this isn't the vibe. And so the criminal psychologists were, they had this gallows humor, they were doing these like arguably the most serious of the, the crimes in the, in the cases. And yet were somehow having fun and having nice lives. And I saw myself and I went, well I wanna do this version. And so I did."

And the thing that interests me most from a research perspective, I mean I did my PhD in False memories. So implanting False memories of committing crime, which was the study that ended up going viral because I was the first to to do it. And I built on a history of people implanting False memories of various kinds of other emotional events. But it was the first time that someone had combined false confessions research and false memory research. And so that was the research of Elizabeth Loftus and Saul Casson. So false confessions was Saul Casson and False memories was Elizabeth, Elizabeth Loftus. And I was just doing them both at the same time. And the question was could you get people to believe that they committed a crime that never happened and confess to it and not just that, but believe that it actually happened. So remember it. And the answer to that in short is yes you can, especially using specific leading and suggestive interview techniques. And so the procedural learning from that, which is what I'm most interested in, I don't like, that's sort of a party trick to be able to actually do it. And that's just so that you can then take that and go, okay, well how do we prevent this? And so I've since trained police lawyers, I've trained people at the ICC, the International criminal court who deal with collective memories. So they deal with hundreds of witnesses at a time and war crimes. And the question is how do we try to preserve as original as possible memory without contaminating it because well, or at least without contaminating any more than it already is. And that's where social psychology I think excels is that we have done lots of research on how social settings change what people say and to some extent what people believe. And I think that's also where actually the leap to things like AI I think is not far. Because ultimately the way that we're engaging with large language models is that, and generative AI in general is that it, it's structured as a social interaction structure as a conversation most of the time now. And that is what we do. I, that is literally what I train the police on doing is how do we make sure that you don't distort people's memories in the process and how to ask good questions. And so you get confabulation from both sides now you get confabulation from AI and from the people. And the problem is that there's a third thing which is the in-between that I'm not sure is getting enough attention right now. And I wish that there was more integration of social scientists like me and people who do investigative interviewing and have done it for decades to understand what is happening in the in-between and so that we can both teach the people and the AI to respond better in that situation."

We have created a tailored experience of something that is most of the time telling you what it thinks you want to hear And then it's uncritically giving that to you. Or I mean sometimes of course there's, you know, other things where it's sort of appraising whether or not this is truthful or not, but it is giving that to you and there's no safeguard from you just going, this is truth and this is my past or this is how I remembered it. And the problem is, is that not only are is AI potentially distorting people and their memories and nevermind the factual basis on which they're relying. But it's also the other way around is that potentially by asking leading or problematic questions, the people are changing how the AI is creating the content, which is in turn on some fundamental level potentially having an impact on how it's discerning truth from fiction. And so that's where the false memory in human minds and confabulation in AI I think are much more similar than we think. And when I first saw AI confabulate hallucinate, I was like, this is what people do all the time. It's just that we can't fact check them all the time. We're not in a conversation constantly being like, well is that quite right? I'm gonna use that for my homework. Right. So it's ah, just it's both juicy and really troubling."

So this is what we find in investigative interviewing, which is police interviewing of witnesses and suspects, is that all you need is a leading question or a suggestive piece of information in a short interaction. Most people, most police officers don't, don't spend a long time and they don't have no memory of this person's past. They know basically nothing about them except for things related to the crime. And yet we know that within that very short, maybe half hour, one hour interaction, people's stories can change fundamentally. And the problem is that if you create, if you have a memory of something that when you pull it up in that social interaction, it's, it's sort of live, it's like active. And when you then finish that interaction, it sets back down. And the thing is that if you put it back in a different way, what's gonna happen is the next time you're going to remember the latest version and you might not realize that it's shifted. And so over time it can shift and you don't realize it. And that's your truth. And that's where even just short interactions can have a profound impact on the human mind. Wow."

Or if they have multisensory details, they're describing in very specific detail what they smelled, what they heard, what they take, whatever it doesn't mean it's necessarily true. Most of the time our autobiographical memories are good enough and that's where memory scientists talk about this as gist memory are gist memory for events, much like for text, you get the gist of it right? You, you're good enough, you generally remember accurately approximately what happened. But it's when you get to the so-called verbatim details, the specific details of memories that you find, people are often really bad. Now, most of the time that doesn't really matter because you remember you hung out with a friend, you remember you were at this university, you remember approximately what, what your favorite cafe was. You remember this important negative or positive event, fine. You don't actually need to know exactly what you were wearing and drinking and saying. But in a criminal justice setting, you do need to remember exactly what you were drinking and saying and and and doing. Right. And so that's where we have this need to break down this human capacity for memory to this level of detail that it's just not made for."

And so this is where in my research and in research like mine, we've implanted well memories, what we call memories or False memories of experiences that never happened at all. So while most things are modifications of real memories, False memories, complete False memories are when you think you experienced something that you didn't. And we all have them. We all have some memories that can't be true. And we usually realize them. For example, when we talk to our parents about our childhood or when we talk to friends and we say, remember that time we did this? And your friend will go, that happened to me. That didn't happen to you. And you become what is known in research as a memory thief, where you've stolen somebody else's memory and you've accepted it, or your brain has accepted it as your own. And that's possibly because the other person told it in such vivid detail that you could imagine it. And basically your brain was like, well, this feels real now. And so the next time you thought about that, maybe, maybe not the next time, but maybe after a couple of times of thinking about it, you started going, this happened to me. Right? And then you integrated into your autobiography."

And this is widely debated exactly how easy it is to implant a specific false memory. It's also one of the big debates around my own research is that when I was writing the memory illusion, which was my first book, and the research that was in line with that, there was this huge debate between me and a couple of other academics about what it means for something to be a false memory and how we should talk about the ease with which they're implanted. And that is still one of the biggest scientific debates in our field. And to me, I think that's, so the, the, the coding stuff is about the difference between what some people call a false belief and a false memory. So I think this thing happened, or I remember this thing happened. And that is a really difficult differentiation often because all we have as social psychologist is what you're telling me. And I can ask you, do you think it really happened or not? Do you believe it really happened? But it is really hard to differentiate. And so I've always thought that you need to ask people about the specifics. Like, how confident are you in this memory? Do you feel things in this memory? Does it feel like other kinds of me Right, sort of the Nate like, describe the nature of this experience rather than being like, do you think this is a real memory? Because that's, that's a hard thing to ask people to do."

And then in terms of the frequency, so in my research, 70% of people became convinced that they committed a crime that never happened or experienced another important emotional event. And that number as well is, is challenged in that people go, well, does that mean that 70% of people can have False memories like this? And the answer is no, obviously not. That's, that's just in my sample. That's just these specific six False memories. And it could be that I think a hundred percent of people are prone to some version of this, just maybe not in this specific study, right? If I had to come up with different False memories to implant, or if I was a different person myself and people trusted me differently, there's the, again, those social factors that make it more or less likely that I'm going to be able to convince you that something happened in your life that you can't remember.

          "value": "2 (112m 35s):\nI think the, the fact that memory can be false in the way that I do it in my study is it's a result of the fact that our minds are made to creatively recombine information to solve problems in the present. And so even the fact that we have this gist memory, it's because we're optimizing data processing. We're basically saying, these are the most important things from these events, and the other de details are irrelevant. Don't remember that gone. And now I'm gonna work with that to try and solve what life comes up with. And the ability to be creative and intelligent relies on our ability to take memories from the past and pieces of them and to creatively recombine them. And so that's what False memories are, except that that then can look bad if you're trying to remember something specific. And so in my research, I used leading and suggestive questions like, close your eyes, picture the event that I'm trying to implant. So I was implanting, for example, you're 14 years old, you were in contact with the police. The police called your parents and you assaulted someone with a weapon. And then the question is, what do you remember? And you say to me as a participant, because you've been selected out to specifically never having had this experience. And just to be clear a weapon, I don't mean a semi-automatic weapon, I mean anything. And usually it was a rock. And so people would say, I found, 'cause a weapon is just anything you use to hurt another person. And I did the study in Canada, we don't have guns in the same way as in some other parts of the world. And so it was unlikely that my participants would've been like, yeah, I totally have all these guns. And so they would take something, an object and hurt somebody else, or they stole something or they hit somebody. So those are three of the conditions. And I randomly assigned people to them and they knew that I'd contacted their loved ones ahead of time. So they, they, they were participating in a childhood memory study, an emotional childhood memory study. And they knew that. And then I'd contacted their parents ahead of time to get information about what they were like as teenagers, where they lived, friends, basic things, and to make sure they hadn't ever experienced any of the target events. And then with that information, I said to the participants, okay, so there's these two things your parents reported happening and one of them is a true one. And so I'd always include a true one to build rapport, which is I'm doing the what not to do of interviewing. Right? Right. I'm, I'm laying it on thick to see what's possible, to see what's possible because you have to, to push it to also show that it's create that I can do this in this context so that we can warn police to not do this. So I said, we had these two incidents that your parents reported and one of them was you had a skiing accident and blah, blah, blah. Let's start with that one. The second one was an instant where you were in contact with the police. Well, we'll get to that. So we'd first have 20 minutes talking about the true memory, which people, you know, they're, they're getting going. It feels good. I've got a structured interview as well, which I'll then mirror in the false memory. So it all feels very ill, legit. And then we get to the second memory and I say this, you know, I, there's this other important memory that your parents were called. And then they'd say, I don't remember that. And I'd say, oh, okay, but I have this really detailed account. All you have to do is remember it. And then I would do the illusion of transparency, which is a really powerful psychological tool, which is to make people feel like they know what's going on when they don't really. And the thing I would do is just say, well, you know, if you want to, we can do this memory retrieval technique called this imagination exercise. And I don't like to call it repression, but sometimes we hide away memories that we don't like about ourselves. And I'm using words that people know and mechanisms that people have heard of that are frankly quite disputed in actual science. But people go, oh, well maybe I did repress this. And then everybody says yes. Like technically they could say no. They could say no, I don't wanna do that. But they go, yeah, of course I wanna know. And so I do this imagination exercise where people close their eyes very simple and just imagine how, what could have happened basically. And every time they say a detail, my very first detail ever, I remember this because I was so excited because they've got their eyes closed, right? And I'm right next to the head of department because they were worried because I was a PhD student that, you know, the ethics of it, the consequences. Like it took like years to get the protocol through ethics and to make sure it was safe. Anyway, I'm, I'm grinning as the person with their eyes closed says the most trivial detail. I remember a blue sky and I remember Going, it's working."

And those details had to come from them because I dunno enough about their lives, right? So this is the other thing with False memories is it's basing it on lots of real pieces of memories, real places, real people, real feelings. They're just woven together in a way that never happened. And so just three interviews and you've got 70% of people confessing to crime. That never happened."

There have been ones also using AI tools. So like whether or not we remember or think we remember incidents differently or better if they were created with AI images of ourselves or videos. So there was a study that came out I this year inclu by a team including Elizabeth Loftus, which showed that if you turn photos of yourself into videos using ai, that you are more likely to believe that those things happened in the way that AI is telling you that they did. Even though AI has absolutely no idea. And that then you are more likely to remember it with high confidence that it happened in the way that this AI has created it. And so we can see that there's lots of versions of this, whether it's in, you know, interpersonal social interactions or or interactions with tech. And there's a big replication that's happening right now in at the university of Must of my study or it's about to happen hopefully actually is where we're at."

So the first thing that's important is for people to understand that they're capable of creating these False memories and that they're not this really unusual hard to generate thing. That they're actually a normal memory process. And that insight is why I wrote the memory illusion is because I think people need to just understand that their minds work like this and that they're really glitchy when it comes to the accuracy of their autobiographical memories. But again, that that's probably ultimately a good thing as well in terms of our overall human experience. But then what happens if you do have an important piece of information that's important to not being distorted, right? You are a witness of a crime for example, and you now know that this is going to be important. What do you do? And the really simple answer is don't trust your brain. Just make sure you write it down. Assume you are going to forget everything. Assume you're going to forget no matter how important, how emotional, how intense, how much you say to yourself, this is the a failure of prospective memory. It's called, I will remember. You won't just assume that you're not gonna remember. And the closer you get to the time at which an event happened, and we call this contemporaneous evidence, the closer you get in time, the more high quality that memory's going to be. And I think there's this myth sometimes that like if you're drunk or if you're high or if you're really emotional that that's somehow you should wait, you should sort of like, like go home, sleep it off and then recall your memory. That is not what the current advice in memory research actually says. It's in the moment, as soon as possible write it down, record it outside your brain, you can do it again when you wake up. But then at least you have an original version."

So I would always say, so when I trained for example, people who Go to deal with warlords in the German military, I was working with agents who are going abroad and who are in these really difficult situations where they had to remember a lot of information that was important for national security. They couldn't just sit there with a tape recorder being like, hey, or like a phone being like, Hey Mr. Warlord, can you just talk into this a bit closer? You can't do that. And so you have to remember it. And so what they were doing is they were coming back from their deployments and they would meet up immediately and have like a team meeting to be like, what did you remember what happened? And the problem is that they would do that before writing their notes. And that is, that is the wrong way around. And so they don't do that anymore. 'cause I've told them not to do that anymore. But it feels good. It feels like collectively we are going to remember more details because you do. But it doesn't mean that those details are right. And so that's where I'd always say have your own version before you talk to anybody then. And my colleague Dr. Anise Fve is one of the experts on the effect of things like eye closure, on memory and collective memory. And she has found repeatedly that if you remember things together, especially if you've already got an original version of your own, you do usually remember more details. And especially if you are helping each other to remember like in a relationship, you'll have someone who's better at remembering certain kinds of details, maybe names or what happened or what you were doing and the other person's better at when it happened. And so you can have these complimentary memories that come in in social situations and you can then create, have more details that are remembered after."

And so a witness or an alleged victim saying that they, you know, having X story the first time they Go to the police and then three years later having a very different, sometimes categorically different account. And the question is, are they just, were they just too shy initially to say what really happened? Were they, were they under pressure from other people? Were they not really remembering, you know, why has it changed? Or could it be that they have been undergone some really problematic like hypnotherapy or just shady therapy in general that has like convinced them that things were maybe much worse than they initially remembered. And it's not that therapy doesn't necessarily like therapy can bring out more details for sure. But the problem is that certain kinds of therapy mirror what we do in false memory research in terms of implanting False memories. And it just makes it really messy and you just, it it makes the quality of the evidence really low because we can no longer tell what is because of the therapy and what's actually remembered."

So there's a lot of therapy that is evidence-based and that is very much focused on tackling sort of feelings and reactions that you have right now. Then there is a, an area or a bunch of areas of therapy, including psychoanalysis, which are very focused on trying to find retroactively sources of mental illness in your personal past. And I am very critical of the kinds of, well both from an explanatory perspective but also from a false memory perspective. I don't think that we are the way we are because of individual incidents that happened to us. I think that is a wild thing to think about the brain, like to be like you are the way you are because of this one interaction you had that one time is like, I mean maybe this explain is a tiny bit of you, but what about all the other life experiences you have every single day? And so I think that there's sometimes an oversimplified searching for answers or sources of problems that we have that I, I don't like, I don't think it's true. And I think that there can be an uncautious approach to memory as you were saying, where you have someone who is saying things and your role as a therapist is to help them manage their emotions now and to feel better. And that's the other thing is that they have a very different role than I do. The therapist is trying to manage the person's wellbeing now, whereas I am looking at the evidentiary equality that is a complete, I'm almost like not quite the other side, but I'm in a very different role."

If I, you know, look at a past relationships, if I just think about or maybe speak to others about the positive things, really think, just think like I, I focus my mind on the memory, on the positive memories and then everything just becomes more positive and I think it makes me feel like I'm way happier about my past. So there, there must be something to that because I, I almost start to forget that the negative stuff happened. And then the same thing on the flip side is if you focus on the negative, then the, the the negative stuff just overpowers everything else and you have a very heavy negative feeling about your past. So that seems like the way to live a healthy life, a happy life is just to focus on the positive, not to sound cliche, but like, like basically modifying your me memories continuously that everything was just great. Is, is there something to that?"

          "value": "2 (130m 5s):\nWell the essence of that is right there is something called state dependent memory, which is that you're more like to remember things that were consolidated or created as memories if, if they match the state that you're in now. So if you are sad now and you your brain sort of just going, you're more likely to remember other sad times because your memory and the emotional state of your brain is basically already activating those networks of sadness and it's like here's some other sad things and shitty things that happened to you. And it's the same with if you are embarrassed. It's, that's the sort of classic one that we usually use as memory researchers is that moment where you do something embarrassing and for the next like six hours all you're thinking of is all the other embarrassing things you've ever done. And it's like your brain is like, would you like some other embarrassing stories? And obviously you're going, no thank you, please stop. But you have this, this spreading activation as it's called of just this synapses just like lighting up new networks and you're going ah, and there's this other memory that's attached to the same feeling. And so it's the same with happiness is that people who are happier tend to remember more happy memories. And so most of the time, unless you're depressed, most people look back at their lives with this sort of rosy reminiscence bias and they're more like to remember the positives than the negatives. But it's not quite the way you were describing it actually. So it's not quite that you only remember the good, the objectively good things that happened. It's more that your interpretation of the things that you've experienced is either neutral or positive. So for me, for example, growing up with my father with parents schizophrenia, that is something that I see as a net positive. So obviously at the time it was experienced in a complicated way, but in hindsight it defined my life and it completely gave me a perspective of the human mind that I just wouldn't have had otherwise. And so I see that as a positive part of my autobiography and that is what good therapy should be doing is it should be taking negative experiences and not overriding them or changing them. I mean our brains do that naturally anyway, but trying to work with what you've got, the experiences, the true experiences, but then just shifting the emotional content so that how you're dealing with them now is, is good."

So they'd have the present day experience of enjoyment in this, on this holiday. I think it was a tropical vacation or something that he'd offer people. That's right. And he, he then said, well, but you're not gonna be able to remember this. Would you still go? And a lot of people say, no, I, I wouldn't go on that holiday if I can't remember it. I think that's interesting and I think that sort of picks or it didn't happen. So the social media generation obviously is perhaps even more in line with that also in terms of how you deal with that in social context, sort of sharing those memories with others and those experiences and which experiences end up being the important ones in our lives."

But also thinking about it yourself so you can auto, it's called auto suggestion when you suggest things to yourself that didn't happen and that often comes from reading something or seeing something or thinking about something or hearing somebody else's story and going, does something like that happen to me? And then you start picturing it and thinking about in what context it could have and then you start to basically implant a false memory in yourself. And so that can happen as well. And I think with things like Neuralink, it would be the same where you'd have the ability to do that. And, but again, I I still think that this interaction between humans and ai or AI like systems is, it is the same as a social interaction, which is why I was saying it's so important I think that we have social psychologists in the, in the room because ultimately whether it's an AI or another person, it's the same brain that you're modifying."

Like modified photos is something pre AI that we had that was already messing with people's minds. Even just what you have in the frame of a shot. So if you take a holiday snap and you've, you're emitting like really important part of what actually happened on that holiday 'cause you're taking a picture of the nicest part and not the, you know, the garbage behind you. Yeah. That is gonna have an impact on your memory as well. And so we've, that versions of that have always existed. And historically, if you go even further back, I mean in some ways we've never been closer to facts than we are now. There's this whole idea of like, oh we're living in this post-truth or blah blah blah, but that is not true. I mean, we didn't even know how to write for a long time. We had no way of reliably cataloging information, nevermind the scientific method, nevermind reliably sharing it with one another or fact checking quickly with things like Google. So I mean we're so close to facts, but that in some ways I think is the, the worry is that we've gotten comfortable feeling like we can just access things that aren't modified or that are less likely to be modified and now they're more likely to be and that can interface with our memories."

What is this giving me that other people haven't experienced? What is it that it taught me about? Who are my friends? What do you know? What are these insights that I've won from this experience?

So like someone will say, I do 60%, the other person will say, I do 50% and you add them up. That's more than a hundred percent and that's basically always the case. And on lots of different fronts, people will claim that they do more. And if you ask them how much their partner does, they will diminish it. And so one of the tips I always say for relationships in terms of memories is actually just sharing what you're actually doing. And so if you've initially it feels a bit cumbersome because it's quite unnatural to be like, I've just taken out, you know, the, the rubbish, I've just taken out the bins or I've just booked us a hotel. But saying it out loud means the other person's able to perceive it and then can add it to sort of their internal like star chart of how much you've done in the relationship and they're more like to actually perceive what you're contributing. Whereas we just assume that people have the same memories we do and that they, they of course she remembers that I took out the bins, but not necessarily, she might not even have really perceived it. But if you're reminding each other of all the things that you're doing, it can feel more balanced over time."

And there are now some really good brain training apps as well that can help to get people to work better with attention to have end back tests. So remember information, a couple of information pieces of information back. So what did I tell you three sentences ago? There's all of these kinds of, well games effectively that you can play that will in fact train how your brain is using its networks. There was one that was developed by researchers, including researchers at the University of Bon in Germany and it's called Neuro Nation. And that's one that I like because it's all these really short games and the idea is that doing one thing like Sudoku or whatever those sort of classics to train your brain, that is only going to be useful up to a point because it's then the same thing over and over again. And what you wanna be doing is lots of different kinds of tasks that your brain has to remain flexible. And so short and many is the answer rather than one thing hard. It's almost the opposite of expertise."

Allegedly there are tricks and it's mostly to make the information more sticky by making it a bigger network in the brain. And so usually when you hear a name, especially like you and I, it's like gone immediately. Yeah. And that's partly because I'd like to think the positive of that is because we're focusing on other things about the person, right? Like what do they, like, what do they, you know, what's this next interaction going to be? Maybe you're a bit nervous about what they're gonna say or what you're gonna say. You're already thinking a step ahead in terms of interpreting the situation. And it's quite an overwhelming situation when you first meet somebody 'cause there's a lot to take in. And so if however a name is important, then you need to a remember to focus when they actually say their name and tune out the other stuff, which could be really difficult. And then to give yourself a monic of, how do I remember this name? So you could have a, a visualize something, you could have a a weird name like word game or some sort of like rhyme that you create for the person. You can say, you know, Julia with big ears. Like whatever works for you as long as it sticks. Now there's a caveat that I recently discovered about myself and to in terms of why I might not have, I have particularly bad memory for names. All of these mnemonic devices that have been studied over the last hundreds of years mostly rely on creating elaborate pictures in your mind. So like memory champions, people who do competitive remembering will tell you that they create these really elaborate images in their heads. I recently discovered that I have aphantasia aphantasia is the inability to create mental imagery. And so when I was trying these techniques, I was going, none of these are working for me. And it turns out it's because I don't see anything whereas other people actually see pictures in their mind. And so I think there's some individual differences stuff going on there that we haven't quite understood."

          "value": "2 (145m 39s):\nThe book Green Crime is really an experiment for me in whether we can apply criminological and Criminal psychology ideas to the area of environmental protection and, and crimes. Because there are people who are convicted of crimes, who are convicted of crimes specifically in relation to destroying the earth and are natural resources or shared resources. I sometimes think about the earth as like a house. And if someone was coming into your house and just setting things on fire and then walking out unpunished, you'd be really upset and correctly so, or poisoning your water or just like leaving a bunch of garbage all over your house. And that's what people are doing on a planetary scale. And the question is, are we responding effectively? And if so, who, who is responding effectively? And then what is the adequate punishment? How should we deal with the people who we, who we catch? And so in this book, the question was are the people who are, for example, I use the the Dieselgate Volkswagen case, which was all about lying about the emissions that were being produced by diesel cars, especially in the United States. And so Volkswagen for 10 years produced these cars that had what was called a defeat device, which is a specific device that makes it look like the cars don't emit very much nitrous oxides. But they actually were way over the legal limit for pollution. Now, why we should care about nitrous oxides is because there is no limit of no like bottom limit of nitrous oxides that is healthy for the, the human lung. So basically any amount is bad for you. And it's related to things like asthma. It's related to things like premature death. It's related to all kinds of negative immediate health effects. And this is what was being pumped outta these cars at wildly high rates, 40 times the legal rates in some cases. And they just lied about it. They just covered it up. They knew they didn't. Well some, some of the people, there's a big debate within the Volkswagen, people who've been convicted, A lot of people say, I didn't really know I'm being scapegoated. Fine. People knew the question how much and who that's up for debate. But certainly people knew 'cause they had to create the thing, like they had to literally create this piece of software to put into the cars. And then when they got caught, they lied about it and eventually the truth came out. But it was like 10 years later. And so the question is, what leads people, clever people, these aren't idiots. These are like clever engineers who are literally working on emissions. Like they know exactly what these emissions do to people. They know exactly how harmful they are, what leads people like that to lie about it, to create these things and to, and to continue lying when they are caught. And so that is one of the cases I, I cover in it and I'm looking at it more as a case study for this kind of crime, which is the sort of corporate collective crime and the lying and just what leads people in these settings to lie and to cover up each other's crimes and to conform to these new norms, these harmful environmental norms. And so I look at it in that way. And then in other chapters I look at like people go undercover and uncover poaching gangs. And there it's some somewhat procedural where it's more, I didn't know that there were undercover agents infiltrating poaching gangs. I didn't know that Interpol was involved in all of these kinds of environmental crime. And how, and it gets quite exciting in some of these cases where you really see the people who are trying to hold people accountable."

          "value": "2 (149m 17s):\nSo what I found most interesting in researching for Green Crime. So I was speaking to people from the United Nations who were doing these huge research reports on things like the international trafficking and wildlife crime. I was talking to people who were infiltrating at the EIA, the Environmental Investigation Agency. It's like the sort of undercover police of the earth. And they're infiltrating these organized crime groups, these gangs that are involved in poaching and other activities. I was talking to this Interpol agent and it's, I think all of these people were talking about very different ways of measuring environmental crime and of responding to it. And so depending on who you talk to, the answer will be very different. How do we fight crime? And the answer is also very different potentially than in other kinds of crime that are more commonly discussed like violent crime. So initially when I started trying to apply Criminal psychology to these really big crimes of that are often also multilevel where you've got bosses, you've got the, whether it's a corporate boss or a an illegal gang boss, you've got the middlemen, you've got the people on the ground who actually have the guns who are killing people or animals or are logging or polluting. And then you've got sort of all these levels of people. And that makes it very different from the kinds of crimes that we often talk about in other kinds of true crime, for example, where it's sort of one person, maybe a couple of people against one other person or a couple of other people. And so the scale is so tiny normally, and it's mostly violent crime, which is mostly it's arguments, it's bad decisions. It's people who are frankly often quite vulnerable themselves, like substance, using people with mental health problems. People who are sleeping rough like the, these are not healthy normal people most of the time who are perpetrating bad crimes. And yet in this context, in environmental crime, this is why I couldn't apply the research directly, you've got some of the smartest people in the world who are still engaging in fraud, who are engaging in the coverup of financial information, who are creating shell companies in order to hide certain things for poaching. The proceeds of poaching. You've got people who are out there illegally fishing and someone's insuring the vessel that has been literally registered by Interpol as a criminal vessel for 10 years and someone's going, I'll insure that. And so you've got these really complicated other factors going on. But I thought that's what was so interesting is ultimately stripping back each layer of each of these crimes and going, who is that person? Who is the person who is insuring this? Who is the person who is out there engaging in illegal fishing on the boat? Who is the person who's financing the boat? Who is the person who's investigating the right? And so looking at all the different levels and I think that's where you get some clarity. And actually at the end of the book, for me, I felt so optimistic I went into Green Crime because I, like most people in the world, at least according to a recent UN climate survey, something like 85 to 90% of people in the world think about the climate crisis on a regular basis. Most people think about it every single day. This idea that there's this like minority of people who care about climate change, that's an illusion that's not true. And if you ask people what the emotional consequences are of those feelings, it's people say things like eco anxiety, anger, sadness, grief, that we're, you know, we're worried about the future. But what you want is for people to feel motivated, energized, purposeful about tackling. One of the biggest issues of our time, and certainly by meeting all of these UN researchers by, I went to so many conferences, you, you have no idea how many conferences I went to. I went to anti-corruption conferences, I went to wildlife time conferences, I went to the specific meeting of multilateral agreements to see how like people were negotiating in the room and the tensions between it, it was wild. It's so interesting. It's such a huge space and it gave me so much hope for the future."

I was at a a European Space Agency conference recently and they're telling us all about the different satellites that are imaging sort of pointing at the earth rather than out into space. And that are imaging through all these different wavelengths exactly what's changing. And basically just chronicling how the earth has changed over time. And a lot of these environmental crimes can be seen from space and can be measured. And so it's like as long as you trust those data, the question then is, okay, these crimes are happening, how do we stop them? And as you say, like I was very much trying, I mean you can't write a book on environmental issues and be apolitical. I think that's impossible. But I certainly was trying to look at it quite logically and go, here's a crime. We all agree this is bad. And they're, these are people who've been convicted. This isn't just like someone who didn't do the recycling. Because also I think that individual level is often detrimental, but these are huge, huge crimes that cost us a huge amount of money to clean up and that cost a huge amount of human health and you know, have these other knock on effects. And our changing certainly the structure of our planet in a way that we can feel already. And so that is the purpose of the book, is to try and show that we actually have lots of laws already. We've got lots of enforcers, we've got lots of researchers on it from space and not space looking at these issues, tracking them and trying to hunt down the criminals. So"

So doing what you think everyone else is doing or know what everyone else is doing. So there's an industry where you know that lots of people are cheating or are fudging the facts in some way, then you both feel the need. And also maybe rationalize the ability to also deceive because it's market forces, right? Like ultimately in a free market or even a controlled one, you've got these people who are just lying to everybody else and they're saying, we're getting to these X outcome by following the rules that everyone else is. And they're not. They're just lying to consumers. They're lying to the regulators, they're lying, they're just lying. And then other people who are trying to be honest and you know, play the game clean, they see the success of this other company and go, well we, we want to have what they have. And then they realize they can't with the tech that exists get there. And so what do they then realize is, well they must be cheating. And so then they start cheating. And so it has this trickle effect of making everyone else fall in line with these well unethical practices that are unethical on so many levels. And then later you get these huge lawsuits because if it, you know, you get caught, then everyone's upset. The investors are upset, the consumers are upset, the environmentalists, the lawyer, everybody's upset with you because you have committed this huge crime."

And that they were given the option not to do it. And ultimately they, most people decided to keep being part of the execution squad even though they had no hatred in their heart, seemingly whatsoever. It's just slight social pressure. You don't wanna be the guy that kind of chickens out just a little bit of social pressure. And you are able to very quickly dehumanize a large number of people and to murder them without any hate in your heart, without anything that could trivially directly be identified as quote unquote evil. Just normal people doing very bad things."

Because as you say, there's a, the conformity, the social pressure, the rationalization, and those are all very human experiences. And that's why also in the book, I always focus on, whistleblower is a big word, but like people who at some point actually helped to uncover what was going on. And that if we're back to the topic of heroes, we're back to bystander effects, we're back to all of the social psychology and Criminal psychology that we've been talking about this whole time. Which is why I thought it was so important to apply that research to this context and to say, okay, so now we've got these people who are willing to engage in these crimes. They know it, but there's also this moment of how do you get out of it and who is going to stop them? And back to the idea of heroes, and you do usually in these cases at some point have a hero, either an external one or an internal one who goes, this needs to stop."

But I mostly get to benefit from other people's research that I summarize into my books. And I think that, I think that the tech that we are now experiencing mostly also gives me hope in that there is this whole new frontier of capacity to implement scientific findings if we want to do so and choose to do so. Like also even in memory interviewing, we were talking about the potential role of AI in distorting our memories. I, when I do talks, when I do corporate talks, I tell people the prompt that I use to use the cognitive interview, which is the best practices in memory interviewing, because you can also tell, you know, AI tools to do the appropriate kind of interviewing if you're talking about memory things. And I created a company called Spot of in 2017, which uses, well it's, we're now building it out to be ai, but it's basically a tool to record important emotional memories and to share them as information with others. So that, I've always been interested in how tech can help us to record important emotional events like with Spot Talk, the Spot and how technology can actually make us feel more human. So there's these capacities, like memory that we're bad at, and tech can help us to overcome some of those shortcomings as long as we use it in a science backed way rather than just sort of free styling. I think the worry I have sometimes is that, as I've said before, we're sort of ignoring the social scientists entirely sometimes when building these systems and it ends up becoming this engineering math problem when that's not actually in terms of the consequences for humanity, what it's going to be. And so I'm always keen on connecting social science isn't big issues."

          "value": "2 (162m 59s):\nSome point I was like, maybe I should do something about this. And so And so I did. And so I, I went to a, well, I did a TED Talk and I was invited to this tech conference called Founders Forum, which is this sort of meeting of tech founders and others in London, but in also a couple other places. And I was invited to this and while there I met the founder of Evernote, Phil Libin. Cool. And so I met Phil Libin at this event and I was talking to him about my research on memory and how I've been wanting to implement or translate what I've been doing into something that could prevent False memories. And specifically I was interested in creating a, an AI or at least machine administered version of the cognitive interview. So that's the neutral approach. It's already a scripted approach, which was helpful. So it's been scripted for decades or a couple of decades. It's been scripted for decades as a cognitive interview. And when we train police on how to do it in places like the uk, it's literally just asking people to basically read a script that we have fine tuned over the years. And what can do that really well? Well Chatbots can do that really well. And so together with Phil Libin and my two co-founders, Dylan and Daniel, I ended up co-founding Spot, which is talk to spot.com if you wanna check it out. And it ended up sort of pivoting into this general reporting tool for workplaces where this was before me too. But it was the idea being that in lots of workplace environments, you have important emotional events that are really important to understand, but are really hard to preserve. And often you have this really bad evidence that you're relying on. So someone at some point sort of goes to HR and says something and somebody else says something else, and you're sort of unsure as a company maybe who to whom to trust, what's real. And so we were trying to streamline that. And so now SPOT is a reporting tool for any kind of compliance issues. And so you can talk to Spot it's called and it's is this chat bot interface that administers the cognitive interview and then creates a report that then gets sent if you want to your employer. So we work with like insurance companies, medical companies, we work with the bar. So all the lawyers in the UK use it themselves, which I always think is a real stamp of approval when the bar council's using your tool. Nice. But again, not, not bars and drinks, bars and lawyers. Yes."

Her books include evil about the psychology of murder and Sadism, the memory illusion about False memories, bi about bisexuality and her new book. They should definitely go Order Now called Green Crime, which is a study of the dark underworld of poachers, illegal gold miners, corporate frauds, hit men, and all kinds of other environmental criminals. Julia is a brilliant and kind hearted person with whom I got the chance to have many great conversations with on and off the mic. This was an honor and a pleasure, And now a quick few second mention of each sponsor. Check them out in the description or at LEX friedman.com/ Sponsors. It is in fact the best way to support this podcast. We got Shopify for selling stuff online, better help for mental health element for electrolytes and ag One for my daily multivitamin, Choose Wise in my friends. And now onto the full ad reads. I try to make em interesting, but if you skip, please still check out the Sponsors. I enjoy their stuff. Maybe you will too to get in touch with me. For whatever reason, Go to let treatment.com/contact. Alright, let's go. This episode is brought to you by Shopify, a platform designed for anyone to sell anywhere with a great looking online store. Obviously it's an incredible platform for selling stuff, but again, I will reiterate as I do often, as we did in the DHH episode, what's also incredible is the implementation of the infrastructure, how the thing is built. The legendary, well-documented Black Friday, I believe, in 2021, Shopify handled 30 terabytes of data every minute, 32 plus million requests per minute hit the servers, 11 million MySQL queries per second were processed. And all of that, mostly Ruby on Rails, the very framework, the very programming language that's not supposed to scale. And it did and it did so incredibly well seamlessly and still maintain the beauty underlying that implementation. There's this writeup I recently read about how they were actually able to make that happen. There's so many interesting details, including the fact that as DHH talked about, that it was a modular monolith and it was scaled horizontally in these very interesting modular ways. Again, that's probably outside of the scope of what I'm supposed to be doing here. Just another chance to celebrate the incredible engineering behind Shopify and all of that to help you sell stuff, you can sign up for a $1 per month trial period at Shopify dot com slash LEX. That's all lowercase. Go to Shopify dot com slash LEX to take your business to the next level today. This episode is also brought to you by Better Help spelled HELP, help they figure out what you need and match it with a licensed therapist in under 48 hours. And boy, in this episode do we delve into the dark aspects of human nature and the human mind. It is so fascinating and what's also I think, inspiring to me about Julia's work is that she approaches every situation, every human being with a deep empathy, realizing that each of us have the capacity for good and evil, and so much of who we are is shaped by our environment. That's a real honest way to deal with cases where humans do horrible stuff to each other, realizing that they're not somehow different than us, that we too, all of us are capable of doing these kinds of things. And when you think of it that way, you can more honestly and rigorously analyze why people do what they do. And yes, it is a reminder how complicated the human mind is. You can explore that human mind with the help of a licensed therapist and better help. It's easy, discrete, affordable, available worldwide. Check them out@betterhelp.com slash LEX and save on your first month. That's better help.com/ LEX. This episode is also brought to you by Element, my Daily Zero sugar and delicious electrolyte mix. I'm currently drinking it even though I'm traveling, it is always watermelon salt. I love it. Also, it's not just the OG drink mix. They got the sparkling water version. That is another form factor that's super delicious, much harder to travel with, but if you're at home and you can order a bunch, it's a delicious different way of consuming element. Again, it's a source of happiness. It makes me feel at home, even when I'm traveling. I'm still, and for the past many, many years, probably over a decade, maybe over 15 years, most days I'm doing one meal a day. I'm doing extremely low carb, not for any reasons except it makes me happy. But when you do that kind of stuff, you wanna make sure that the electrolytes are on point and I use the elements for that. You should consider doing the same. Get a free eight count sample pack with any purchase. Try it@drinkelement.com slash LEX. This episode is also brought to you by AG one, an allin one daily drink to support better health and peak performance. We got a NextGen version now, always iterating, always improving. A G one does a simple thing and it does it well and makes sure that all your nutritional basis are covered. I make an a G one drink, I throw it in the freezer for like 10 minutes, 20 minutes, so it's nice and super cold and I drink it after a long run. Sit back, think about the universe and my place in it and it's become a little ritual that brings joy, joy to my life. Although today it's pouring outside. So I was about to go for a run and then drink in a one, but I think I'm gonna have to skip the run unless I'm insane, which I am. But no matter what, I'll drink in a one in a little bit here. Some of my happiest long distance runs have been when it starts pouring all of a sudden and at first there's a resistance, maybe I should find some cover. And then you just say, screw it. I just accept the fact that you're going to be soaking wet and especially if the rain is at all warm, it's just becomes this experience where you are truly one with nature and kind of stop giving a damn about the conventional experience of comfort and you're just there alive in the moment. It's a, it's a great, great experience. So now I just talk myself into screw it. I'm gonna go for a run anyway, they'll give you a one month supply of fish oil when you sign up@drinkagone.com slash LEX. This is LEX Friedman podcast to support it. Please Check out our sponsors in the description where you can also find LINKS to contact me, ask questions, get feedback, and so on. And now, dear your friends, here's Julia Shaw. You wrote the book Evil, the Size Behind Humanity's Dark Side. So lots of interesting topics to cover here. Let's start with the continuum. You described that evil is a continuum. In other words, the Dark Tetrad Psychopathy, you see it as a Narcissism. Machiavellianism are a continuum of traits, not a binary zero one label of monster or non monster. So can you explain this continuum?"

          "value": "2 (8m 43s):\nYeah, so each trait on the Dark Tetrad as it's called, which is the four traits that are associated with dark personality traits. So things that we often associate with the word evil like Sadism, which is a pleasure in hurting other people. Machiavellianism, which is doing whatever it takes to get ahead Narcissism, which is taking too much pleasure in yourself and seeing yourself as superior to others. And then there's Psychopathy, psychopathic personality specifically often lacks in empathy and it's usually characterized by a number of different traits including a parasitic lifestyle, so mooching off of others, deceptiveness lying to people. And again, that empathy dimension where you are more comfortable hurting other people because you don't feel sad when other people feel sad. Now, all of those traits, Psychopathy, Sadism, Machiavellianism and Narcissism, all of them have a scale. And so you can be low on each of those traits or you can be high on each of those traits. And what the Dark Tetrad is, it's actually a way of classifying people into those who might be more likely to engage in risky behaviors or harmful behaviors and those who are not. And if you score high on all of them, you're most likely to harm other people. But each of us score somewhere. So I might score score low on Sadism, but higher on Narcissism. And in all of them I'm probably subclinical. And so this is the other thing we often talk about in psychology is that there's clinical traits and clinical diagnoses, like someone is diagnosed as having Narcissism or there's subclinical, which is you don't quite meet the threshold, but you have traits that are related and that are so important for us to understand in the same context."

And so the question of would you kill baby Hitler is sort of a meant to be something that gets people chatting about whether or not they think that people are born with the traits that make them capable of extreme harm towards others or whether they think it's socialized, whether it's something that maybe in how people are raised is sort of manifests over time. And with Hitler, we know from certainly psychologists who have poured over his traits over time and looked at who he was over the course of his life, there's always this question of sort of was he mad or bad? And with the answer to was he mad? Well, he certainly had some characteristics that people would associate with, for example, maybe Sadism with this idea that he was less high on empathy is probably also showcased in his work. But in terms of whether he was born that way, I think the answer usually would be no. And actually in his early life he didn't showcase quite a lot of the traits that later he sort of defined the horrors that he was capable of. So would I go back in time and kill Bbe Hitler? The answer is no, because I don't think it's a straight line from baby to adult and I don't think people are born evil."

So for me that word is it's the end of a conversation. It's when we call somebody evil, we say, this person is so different from me that I don't even need to bother trying to understand why they are capable of doing terrible things because I would never do such things. I am good. And so that artificial differentiation between good and evil is something that certainly with the book I'm trying to dismantle. And that's why introducing continuums for different kinds of negative traits is really important. And introducing this idea that the, there's nothing fundamental to people that makes them capable of great harm. We all have the capacity to kill people and murder people and do other terrible things. The question is why we don't do those things rather than why we do do those things quite often. So I think humanizing and understanding that we all have these traits is the most important thing in, in my book certainly."

And on on top of dehumanization, there's also this other thing called deindividuation, which is where you see yourself as part of the group and you no longer see yourself as an individual. And so it's this fight of us versus them. And so you need both of those things. You need that sort of collapse of empathy for other people, the people who are on the other side. And you need this idea that you can be swallowed by the group and that gives you a sense of also the cloak of justice, the cloak of morality, even when you know maybe you're on the wrong side. And, and that's where, I mean, getting into sort of who's on the right side of each war is always a more complicated issue. But certainly calling other people evil and calling the other side evil and dehumanizing them is is crucial to most of these kinds of fights."

Also the title of my book is Evil or in the UK Market It's Making Evil, which is a reference to a nietzche quote, which is thinking evil is making evil. The idea being that evil is a label we place onto others. There's nothing inherent to anything that makes it evil. And so I also think that we need to, well dismantle that and empathize with people we call evil because if we're saying that this is the worst kind of act or worst kind of manifestation of what somebody can be. So if someone can destroy others, torture others hurt others, I work as a criminal psychologist, I work a lot on sexual abuse cases, on rape cases, on murder trials. And so in those contexts that word evil is used all the time to go, this person is evil. And if we're doing that, then we need to go, okay. But what we actually want is we don't really just wanna label people, we wanna stop that behavior from happening. And the only way we're gonna do that is if we understand what led that person to come to that situation and to engage in that behavior. And so that's why evil empathy I think is crucial because ultimately what we want is to make society safer. And the only way we can do that is to understand the psychological and social levers that led them to engage in this behavior in the first place."

Or if you're sitting in front of people that are actual like convicted criminals, what's the way to conduct that interview? Because to me, I want to understand that human being, they also have their own narrative about why they're good and why they're misunderstood and they have a story in which they're not evil and they're going to try to tell that story and some of them are exceptionally good at telling that story. So if it's for public consumption, how would you do that interview?"

I mean, I also speak with people who I think are, or have, I know have committed terrible crimes and I have spoken to these people because as a criminal psychologist, that's often part of my job. So what's interesting I think when you're speaking to people who have committed really terrible crimes or certainly who've been convicted of terrible crimes, is that not only is it potentially insightful because they might give you a real answer and not just a controlled narrative about why they committed these crimes. If they are either maintaining their innocence or they're more reluctant to do that, I think even the narrative that they are controlling that they're being very careful with still tells us a lot about them. So I think certainly in my research on environmental crime as well, what we see is that people use a lot of rationalization and they say things like, well, everybody's doing it. And if I hadn't done this first, somebody else would've done this waste crime or this other kind of crime. And so there's this rationalization, there's this normalization, there's this diminishing of your own role and agency. And that still tells us a lot about the psychology of people who commit crimes because most of us are very bad at saying sorry and saying, I messed this up and I shouldn't have done that. And instead what our brains do is they try to make us feel better and they go, no, you're still a good person despite this one thing. And so we try to rationalize it and we try to excuse it, we try to explain it and there is some truth to it as well because we know the reasons why we engage in that behavior and other people don't have the whole context. So we also do have more of the whole story. But on the other hand, we need to also face the fact that sometimes we do terrible things and we need to stop doing those terrible things and prevent other people from doing the same."

So I think looking at historical photos of children or sometimes even kids in other cultures, it's like, oh, why are they all so serious? Yeah, but our creepiness radars are also way off. So this is something that I've been interested in for a long time as well, is that we have this intuitive perception of whether or not somebody is trustworthy. And that intuitive perception according to ample studies at this point is not to be trusted. And one thing in particular is whether or not we think someone is creepy, including children. But usually the research is done of course on adult faces and with adults. And there's only recently did we even really define what that vague feeling of creepiness is creep. And it has a lot to do with just not following social norms. And this is something we see that transfers to other contexts like why people are afraid of people with severe mental illness and psychosis. If you're on the the bus or the tube in London and someone's talking to themselves and they're acting in an erratic way, we know that people are more like to keep a distance. There was one study where they literally had a waiting room where they also had people with chairs. And the question was, how many chairs would you sit away from someone you know has a severe mental illness? And the answer is you sit more chairs away and there's a physical and psychological distancing that's happening there. And it's not because people with severe mental illness are inherently more violent or more dangerous. That is not actually what the research finds. It's that we perceive them as such because we perceive them as weird. Basically we go, this isn't how you're supposed to be behaving. And so I'm worried about this and so I'm going to keep my distance. And so creepiness is much the same and that's where you can totally misfire whom you perceive as creepy just because they're not acting in the way that you expect people to act in society."

And we also don't trust people potentially who are too attractive, but again, deviation from the norm. And so if you're deviating in any way that can lead to, well your, your assessment being more wrong, but also you assessing people as more negative. And so with yeah, but with creepiness, the, the main thing that bothers me as a criminal psychologist is that tangential to creepiness is this general idea of trustworthiness and that you can tell whether somebody is lying. And I've done research on this as have lots of other people like Fry is one of the leading researchers on deception detection. And he has found in so many studies that it's really hard to detect whether someone is lying reliably and that people, especially police officers, people who do investigative interviewing, they have this high confidence level that they, because of their vast experience, can in fact tell whether the person across from them is lying to them, this witness, this suspect. And the answer to that, even that if you take them into experimental settings, they are no better than chance at detecting lies and yet they think they are. And so again, you get into this path where you're going to miss people who are actually lying to you potentially. And you're going to potentially point at innocent people and say, I think you're guilty of this crime. And you go hard on that person in a way that might even lead to a wrongful conviction."

There's also some research specifically on sort of faking good in, for example, parole decisions. So when it comes up to someone who is, there's a legal decision to be made as to whether this person's gonna be released from prison or released from just detention in general. And then the person will act in a particular way, sort of mimic a good prisoner, mimic someone who's safe to be released into society. And then the committee goes, oh well you know this, this person's doing great and so they're ready to to be released and then they make the wrong decision because that person's been faking it. So I think with Psychopathy it's a bit complicated. It's, there has been some sort of historically as well some concern that certain treatment for Psychopathy, especially empathy focused treatment, makes people with Psychopathy more likely to fake empathy and to weaponize it. But then there's other research which finds that if you use other kinds of interventions, it's like Jennifer scheme in California who does research on people with Psychopathy who have committed severe crimes. And she specifically creates these treatment programs that aren't just around empathy, but they're more around almost learning the rules of society and convincing people that actually being pro-social is a better way to get what you want in life. And so there's, there's a real need for tailored treatments to deal with, especially certain kinds of personality traits, dark personality traits to try and convince people basically actually being pro-social is the better path rather than just going hard on, you know, empathy and things that they don't maybe also see as faults with themselves."

So a lot of the nietzche quotes I use as well are, some of them I like because they speak to the chapters I write about but, and the issues I write about. But some of them I also like because they are how people think about evil and people who are labeled evil. And I do think with gazing into the abyss and the abyss back, it's more of a, you're trying to find it and, and that's why in some ways that doesn't work actually because it isn't a total blank, it isn't the abyss. There are in fact things that you can see even, even if it's just superficially and patterns you can recognize to help you and key decision makers, especially in legal settings, make better decisions around people like this. So when they see these patterns, they act a better way. So yeah, I I, I get asked a lot as a criminal psychologist, do you carry the cases that you deal around with you? So some of the cases involve, you know, huge amounts of witnesses, huge amounts of potential wit victims. And so in these cases there are very visceral descriptions sometimes of heinous crimes. And I think that as someone who does this work, you can't be someone who sees it as anything other than a puzzle. So you have to look at it and go, here's the different pieces of information. What I am doing is pattern recognition. I'm not here to emotionally invest in each of these victims or potential victims. That's not my role. There's therapists for that. There's other people who do that work. I am here working with the police, I'm here working with lawyers, I'm here looking at it more sort of objectively to see how this all fits together. And so I think that's how I engage with it. I see it as this, this puzzle that I'm trying to figure out."

So when you speak with others, sometimes like even when I say we shouldn't use the word evil, people go, no, but you have to. Does that mean you're trivializing things? And the answer is no, I'm not trivializing. I'm just trying to understand also like sympathizing or being empathetic towards people whom others have written off is always going to get that response from some people. And I mean there are real questions around whom we're platforming and what that has and what role we have as content creators. Both of us, of the people we talk about how we cover them, I often come across this in true crime work that I do. 'cause I get asked to do TV shows, I host TV shows and I host BBC podcasts. And there's always the question of sometimes people commit murder to become famous and should it be a blanket ban that we don't cover those cases or should we cover those cases but in a different way or should we anonymize the, so there's, it doesn't mean that you shouldn't never cover that case. It just means that you need to think about it."

And just to be clear, bad people, much like the title Evil is sort of tongue in cheek where the idea is it's people whom we refer to as bad people. And then it's always a question of like who are these quote unquote bad people? And are we all capable of doing these terrible things? But one of the most certainly problematic dark cases that we covered was the Robert Pickton case and the episodes are called Piggy's Palace because that was the nickname for the farm where Robert Pickton brought victims whom he had kidnapped and then he killed them and he did terrible things to their bodies. And rumors have it certainly that he fed some of these victims to pigs. Now, one of the reasons I covered that case is actually because it was influential in my own career. So Robert Pickton is one of the most famous Canadian Serial Killers of all time. And as I was doing my undergrad at Simon Fraser University in Canada, I was being taught by someone called Stephen Hart. And Stephen Hart was an expert witness on the Robert Pickton trial. And so he was keeping us abreast of some of the developments of what he was covering. And it, I found it so interesting and I loved Stephen Hart as a person and he seemed to have this sense of humor, this gallows humor around it all, despite being faced with one of the arguably worst people in Canadian history. And I thought that that was so interesting that someone could be so nice and so kind and so wonderful and be an expert witness for these kinds of people. And so that's one of the reasons I went into the field is because of this case as well. And so we had him on the show, so he came on to bad people and we interviewed him for it."

She was in the press and so she has worked with lawyers to educate the court on memory in lots of really, really controversial cases. But the way she would explain it is that it's still her role to just train people and teach people on how memory works. She's not there to decide whether people are guilty or innocent, but she is there to help people distinguish between fact and fiction when it comes to how our memories work or don't."

And this is something we see with a lot of Serial Killers is that they have this loneliness, which I think also not only contributes to them committing the crimes in the first place, but also allows them to get away with things because they don't have as much of a social network or any social network that is helping them to do what's called a monitoring to understand what's true and what's not. And so when you see people get radicalized in their own thoughts, whether that's in sense in the sense of things like schizophrenia, where you've got psychosis, you've got delusions, maybe command hallucinations, that's when you think you're hearing voices and someone is telling you that you have to do something, usually something harmful to other people. And if you don't follow those, you will hear those voices forever. They're profoundly distressing and they're one of the aspects of schizophrenia that if you have it does make you more prone to violence. And so for these kinds of cases, if you don't have someone intervening, whether that's a family member or a therapist saying how, how can you tell whether this thought is real? Maybe that thought, maybe you're not hearing that voice right? Maybe that aspect of what you're thinking isn't true and bring you back and closer to reality. You can just wander off to whatever alternate universe that you might live in in your head. And it's the same with radicalization in other contexts is that you see that people who drift more and more into a certain group that has certain beliefs that are maybe divorced from the evidence, divorced from reality, you can see that people will get more extreme over time. And unless you have a tether that brings you back, that allows you to do reality monitoring, it's gonna be very difficult to to find your way out of that. So with Serial killers, we find this reality monitoring problem, and I think part of that's related to the lack of social networks that people have."

So if you look at some of the famous Serial Killers tab, Bundy, John Wayne Gacy, Jeffrey Dahmer, is there other things we can say about their psychology that motivates them? So interesting, the tether to reality, I mean, loneliness is a part of the human condition. It is, in fact, one of its side effects is you can get untethered and then with some of these brains, I guess the untethered goes to some dark place,"

There's something in that where I can't help but go, that's so sad. I don't go, oh my God, how terrible. How awful. And of course it's atrocious, of course it's heinous.

And one of the reasons I think that is because you can see neighbors turning on each other, especially if you look historically at the start of wars or big political moments where you have people who would've called each other friends turning each other into the police, killing each other, doing terrible things. So I think all it takes is to become convinced that the people you think are your friends are actually your enemies, whether that's just in your own world or in a larger political national landscape that I think, I don't think it takes all that much for us to be capable of doing terrible things, but that's also why it's really important when things are good and when you're not at war and when you have the capacity to think deeply about important issues to train your mind on these thoughts of knowing that things like loneliness can manifest in these extreme ways that things like Jealousy and aggression, that they can turn into murder, that they can turn into these horrible versions and to then also spot the red flags if you start going down that path. I think if we don't rehearse evil, if you will, we are much more likely to engage in it, especially in those moments where we don't have much time or energy to really think about what we're doing."

And most women as well, more than 50% of women have fantasized about killing somebody. So murder fantasies are incredibly common and certainly according to some researchers, that's a good thing. Being able to rehearse and think through doing the most terrible things is it's a great dress rehearsal for also how we don't want to live our lives. And only if you are able to fully think through what would I actually be like if I was engaging in this, what would I be thinking? Who would I be with? What would be my, the group that I am charging against this other person, you know, who, who am I there with? As you said, like really putting yourself in the shoes of these people who've done terrible things. That is how you also realize that you do not want those consequences. And so yeah, you maybe wanna murder this person, but you don't really wanna murder this person that's that intuitive sort of animalistic brain coming in. But then luckily we have higher reasoning that goes, actually, if you think this through, that's a pretty terrible consequence for yourself. So the better thing to do is not to murder this person. So I think it's adaptive to be able to fantasize and think about these things. Obviously if you start getting to a point where you're ruminating and you're going these circles where you're constantly fantasizing about doing dark things, especially to a specific person, I'd always advise seeing somebody to talk to like a psychologist for example, because that then does become a risk factor for acting on those dark fantasies. But up to that point, if it's just a fleeting thought or something that sort of in in one day you have these thoughts, that is totally healthy, I would say."

          "value": "2 (39m 57s):\nYeah. So it's also been called the heroic imagination. So someone who has studied evil quote unquote at length, it's called Philip Zimbardo. He did the Stanford Prison Experiment. And that was an experiment, which is, I mean it's now been torn apart in various ways. It was absolutely influential for psychology. It's where participants were randomly assigned whether they would be prisoners or guards in a mock prison experiment. And then for a number of days they were told to do various things and it got outta control and the guards went way over what they were supposed to be doing, and they effectively started pseudo torturing some of these inmates or these pretend inmates. And the whole thing had to be stopped prematurely. But it was really fundamental in showing how just by randomly being assigned into guard the person in charge or inmate, you can within a matter of days, have a completely different way of thinking about one another. And so Philip Lombardo has also spoken at length about evil and that all of us are capable of it in the right circumstances, but he also is a big proponent of what he calls the heroic imagination. And the heroic imagination is really what the purpose of everything I do is the purpose of what I do isn't just to go, Ooh, this is curious and to stop there. The point is to then prevent it and to prevent it in ourselves because that's, I think ultimately what has to happen. You can't do a top down sort of government level approach to trying to be so tough on crime that no one will ever commit crime. That's impossible. But you can change, sort to say it in an attacky way, the hearts and minds of individuals to recognize the pathways towards evil and to go, wait, I'm, I'm off track. I don't wanna go this way and I'm gonna stop myself here and here's how I can find my way back. And so the heroic imagination is exercising that I, I see someone on the street, how do I make sure that they're okay? How do I not become a bystander? And actually the bystander stuff is interesting because there was a really famous case, the murder of Kadi Gena, and there were all of these both ear and eyewitnesses. So an ear witness is someone who just hears things. And an eyewitness is someone who sees the crime happening and they didn't intervene in the murder of this woman. And so this case was often taken as this almost example of, look how terrible human beings are. We just walk by, we don't care about what's happening to strangers on the streets. And actually what's happened since is that there's been lots of other bystander experiments and they have not substantiated this. So we need to be very careful with looking at these extreme cases and going, how horrible that this happened to this one person. And it is, but that doesn't mean that that's always how it happens. And so actually what we find in bystander research is that most of the time bystanders do intervene. It's just when there has already been a crowd that has accumulated, you read the room and you assume, well, nobody else has intervened yet. And so it must not be a real problem. That desire to not stand out in a negative way is often what hinders heroism. I mean that's why we look at heroes, people who especially risk their own lives to save others, especially strangers. We see them with a sort of respect that nobody else gets. And that's because we recognize that we might not be capable of that. If I saw a stranger drowning in a river, would I really risk my life get jumping in the river to maybe save them? Ah, it's, I think that's a big question mark. And so when people do that, especially when people almost have this inherent reaction that they just jump in, they just go for it. That is something that is a really admirable quality and that we as humans do celebrate and we should. And I think often we should celebrate those incidents more and not the, you know, the bystander moments where we didn't inter intervene. We should be normalizing. Intervening."

          "value": "2 (44m 21s):\nMurder is a really interesting crime because most of the time it's perpetrated for reasons that we don't like as a society. So as a person who talks a lot to the news and also to producers who are trying to make true crime shows who don't necessarily have a deep understanding of psychology, let's just say, and who come at you with myths where you go, oh no, we're not, we're not gonna talk about that. We're not gonna talk about whether or not the mom is to blame for this person killing somebody. I hate that ex. That's one of my, my least favorite sort of the trauma narrative of all people who do terrible things must have had a terrible childhood, I think is really problematic. What really happens in murder most of the time, which is not what you see on TV because it's really boring, is it's a fight that gets out of control. And if you look at the real reasons stated, it's things like, this person owed me $4 and so I killed him. This person stole my bike, this person, I mean, it's these really stupid reasons and it is just this bad decision in the moment, an overreaction to a fight, to an argument. And it wasn't planned. It's not some psychopath sharpening their knives waiting for months to try and kill this person. And we don't like that because there's something called the victimization gap, which is that the impact of this extreme situation on the perpetrator, there's a huge gap between that and the impact on the victim and their family. So the victim loses the life, whereas the perpetrator, sure they get imprisoned, but that at best, right, if you will, in terms of justice. But they don't have the same kinds of consequences. And we don't like that. We like things that have extreme consequences to have extreme reasons. And so that's why I think there's this real desire to show Serial Killers and to show people who are in fact planning murders for a really long time and then engage in them rather than this fight that goes outta control or someone drink driving or someone who is, I mean unfortunately intimate partner homicide is also one of those situations that is common, one of the top four reasons for murder as well. But that's not the almost glamorized version that we see of murder online or that we see in the news. So I think it's always important to talk about murder as something that is rarely inherent to an individual. Very few people want to murder. They might fantasize about it, but they don't wanna go through with it. And very few people who do engage in murder wanted to do it in that instance. Nevermind again. I think in general we have the way that we look at lots of crimes upside down. So we put murderers in prison for a really long time because we think that that's justice, which is, sure, that's one version where it's an eye for an eye kind of, you know, life for life. There's obviously the more extreme version of that, which is the death penalty, which I don't adhere to, but I could see the rationalization of you, you stole somebody else's life, so you don't deserve to have one. But there's also the other side, which is if we're looking at prevention, murder is really like they're not gonna, people aren't gonna go out and murder again. So that is, that's a really low risk in terms of recidivism actually. And high risk are things like fraud and elder abuse and sexual violence. And so in some ways, sometimes our sanctions are upside down in terms of how we can actually make society safer and they're in line more just with how we perceive justice to work. So there's, there's big fundamental questions about how we organize our justice systems and what we want 'em to be for."

And quite often when you speak with victims' families, there is this divide where you have some who are much more keen on something called restorative justice, which is where they, what they want is for the person to apologize, the perpetrator, to apologize, to explain how it happened. Also, quite often, I mean you look at the, some of the other consequences in the other context, it's sort of like teenage boys who are part of gangs, for example, is the other context, and it's a teenage boy killing another teenage boy. Like these are kids and the parents of a teenage boy understand that this isn't, you know, they don't think of this other perpetrator as this grown man who has, I don't know it, I think we think of it as this fight between the parents of both teenage boys in that case. But really often what parents want is to just understand how this could happen and in some ways to allow the other teenage boy to still have a life and to not steal theirs as well, or his as well. So there's that restorative justice model where forgiveness, I think, belongs to the families. Some families, of course want the most extreme punishment. That's also, I can understand how that would be a, a response that's triggered if you've suffered a severe loss. But if we're looking to make society safer, putting people who've killed in prison is actually not the answer, right? Because if we want society to be safer, it should be based purely on what is most likely to deter crime and who is most likely to engage in it. And that's where I think we've got it upside down."

And so, and, and the idea of entitlements. So I think one thing that we see often in crimes of all sorts actually is the sense of entitlement that drives the perception that I'm allowed to engage in X because of something else, and I deserve to have a life that looks like this, but I don't. And so I'm going to go take it or I'm going to go do something to show my dissatisfaction in life. And so if you think that all men deserve to have a happy life, sort of a Disney version with with a woman at home who's taking care of the kids, and this this sort of white picket fence ideal that we've been sold, we haven't been told that that is what we should have. Like I, I understand where it comes from, and the question though is are we entitled to that or is that the idea that that's something we should strive towards? And I think the answer is no. Nobody's entitled to a good life. I would like to see freedoms and rights manifest in such a way that everyone is able to achieve the kind of life that they themselves want, but you're not entitled to it. And so that's where I think it can get a bit crossed and we can be sold these lies that are basically impossible for everybody in society to achieve. And and understandably people get angry. And if you're angry and if you feel entitled, and if you're in this group where everyone else is thinking the same way as you, yeah, that can make you dangerous."

          "value": "2 (51m 59s):\nSo Tinder Swindler, that was a person who pretended on Tinder to be a rich guy who had this lavish lifestyle, and he would match with women on Tinder and very quickly love bombed them. So he would send them all kinds of messages and immediately start being very emotional, very sharing, pretend that he is messaging from his private jet or actually messaged from his private jet, but pretend that he's in love with this person very quickly. And then he would invite women, in this case, Cecilia, to very expensive luxurious dates. So he would whisk them away to Paris, or he would show them his private jet, or he would take them to a really expensive restaurant almost to prove that he in fact is this really wealthy guy. And he would simultaneously be building up the story of a future together. And you see this in people who are really problematic in relationships in a lot of ways. I mean, this is not just in scams or in criminal settings, but problematic relationship styles often involve someone who is creating this idea of a future together that you can just see it now, you know, our kids in the garden running around you are the only one for me. That kind of language, like almost planning your wedding on the third date, that kind of thing is what he would weaponize. And she, Cecilia Wa was looking for love. She wanted all of those things. And so it worked really well. And what he ended up doing is defrauding her of lots of money and she ended up taking out loans and her family were giving her money to help. What he was saying was this critical situation, very classic fraud, it's critical situation where he was being followed, he was under attack and he needed her to pay for some things. He needed her to pay for some flights until she ran outta money. And then, then, then she realized that this all was a big fraud. This was a, a love scam. So the reason that we spoke with her is partly to show how it can happen. And I think it's really important to remind people that this is something everybody is capable of believing fraud works because people know what we wanna hear and they tell us the things we wanna hear. And so I think all of us, there's a tailored version of fraud that could appeal to basically everybody if they have enough information about you."

And that's often a man in a relationship that's sort of traditionally 'cause it falls often along these gender, gender lines. But the problem is if that person then starts to weaponize the fact that they're controlling the finances and starts using words like, I'm gonna give you your allowance, instead of going, you've paid as much into this as I have. And so this is our shared money and starts using that and controlling things and controlling how the other person lives in that relationship. That's when you get into things that are called course of control and things like Jealousy can also be used in that way."

And I personally think that Jealousy is basically always a red flag because what it means is that the person who is jealous isn't secure in the relationship. And the reason that they're not secure in the relationship is either because the relationship is wrong for them or because they are insecure in themselves. And I don't think it is a sign of love. I don't think it is a sign of, you know, you wanna protect your mate. I think it is mostly control and it's the desire to control and to possess. And Jealousy we know is a precursor to intimate partner violence almost always, as in not all Jealousy leads to violence of course, but all violence is the Jealousy is a precursor. And quite a lot of that is imagined things that the, the partner is doing, not even based on reality. That we go back to our deception detection research where we're bad at telling whether someone's lying or not. And so if you're basing how you're interacting with that person on a faulty lie detector, you're gonna make bad decisions. So the research also bears out that most people are really bad at Monogamy. So most people either have cheated on a significant other, maybe not their current, significant other, but a significant other or have cheated multiple times. And that's, that's just consistently found in the research."

And I think that at least based on the research on how people actually behave, they're not actually behaving in a monogamous way. If you're cheating on your partner, that is not Monogamy, that is polyamory potentially. So the love of multiple people and it's lying and it, and it's, it doesn't have to be that way. So I'm polyamorous and I, I believe that you can love multiple people. I don't know that everyone is always going to meet lots of people at the same time that they're gonna love. But I think that there's been a move towards more people embracing open relationships and non-traditional relationship structures. And I think that is healthy to at least have as an option. I think the idea that there's this one size fits all for relationships is really harmful to a lot of people and it just doesn't really work for everybody. Well,"

So I'm bi has also found that people who are bi are more likely to be in non-traditional relationships. And one of the reasons for that is probably also because we constantly get asked, justify our Sexuality as well. And so if constantly you're being asked if one person's enough for you, if one gender's enough for you, if you're in a relationship with one person, for example, you know, if I'm in a relationship with a man, do you, do you miss women? And it's like, I don't ask you that. If you're in a relationship with a woman, do you miss women? Like you probably do, but that's just other women than you're partner. It has nothing to do with being bi. And so I think there's this constant barrage of questions of what does it mean? Is it real? How do you choose? What does a relationship look like? Do you constantly want threesomes? Like there's this constant hypersexualization also, especially of women that we find in the research that can also lead to really negative outcomes for mental health and for things like risk of sexual violence. But on the other hand, you've got bisexual people themselves saying, yeah, but I feel like I also have the superpower that I can love more widely and gender doesn't really matter in terms of whom I'm capable of loving. And so relationship structures almost come with that conversation. It's not that we need to be non-monogamous or that we need to be in these kinds of relationships. It's more that I think if you've engaged so deeply with your Sexuality, partly 'cause society's forced you to, then you're also gonna be thinking about relationship structures more generally and going, actually I'm gonna choose this one. Yeah,"

And I did that after I created a bisexual research group. So I wasn't a Sexuality researcher, but as a bi person and a scientist, I was interested in the science of bisexuality and I couldn't really find it, it was really hard to figure out what people were actually learning about bisexual people in comparison to other kinds of queer people. And one of the things I've found is that the terms that are used are not necessarily bi. And so it could be things like blurry sexual. So if you type into Google scholar the word bisexual, you're gonna get a lot of confusing things also because bisexual is used for like two sexes or you have multiple sex or you can change. And so they're, they're bisexual, right? Yeah. Which is different entirely. And so I think partly out of that, researchers started using words like pl sexual and omnisexual is another one. And so if you're looking for research on this, pl sexual is probably the word, but what"

          "value": "2 (67m 15s):\nThe biggest thing that researchers find people misunderstand about bisexuality is that it's a phase and that it's this idea that it's transient, that it's always changing and that it's a stepping stone. So I think a lot of people still see bisexuality as on the way to gay town, sort of like you're, you're on your way but you haven't quite committed and you're still stuck in expectations of society. You haven't quite let go yet, but really you're gay. And that's especially true for men. And so when you look at research on bisexual men, which is actually how the research started. So I think now when we think of bisexuality, we think of women, and it's true that today twice as many women identify as bisexual as men. But if you look at the history of this and the research on bisexuality over time, it was the other way around. So someone called Alfred Kinsey was one of the first Sexuality researchers in recent history, certainly. And he, after World War II, did this really big study of sexual behavior in the human male. It was called, he was a biologist himself. And so he thought in taxonomies and he was doing research on gall wasps, so insects and this idea of human Sexuality was sort of thrown at him after the war because there's also this whole move to get people to well reproduce and to rebuild America. And so Sexuality was partly, and sex specifically was becoming more of an area of interest, both in terms of research and in terms of policy and funding. And so Alfred Kinsey was asked, do you want to do a class on human sexual behavior? And he was like, I know nothing about this. And so he spent about a year just listening to students' questions about like what they wanna know about sex. And he realized that he was looking for research to try and build up this course that he was probably going to teach. And he realized that he couldn't answer most of their questions because the research hadn't been done. And so a lot of the questions were around what is normal? You know, if I feel this during sex, is that normal? How often do people have sex? Should I want these? What about these fantasies? What does it mean? What if I have homosexual fantasies? What if I engage in this kind of, and so he was looking at all of these questions and collating them. And then he went out and did these huge studies and he interviewed thousands of people himself, but also had all these research assistants who were out there interviewing people in America about their sexual behavior, which I mean, just picture the time. It's like the 1940s. This is quite a conservative time. I mean certainly more than we might expect now. And here's this researcher asking incredibly personal questions about thousands and thousands and thousands of people. And he ended up finding, and this is one of the big findings in this book that he published called Sexual Behavior in the Human Male, which was a best seller for an entire year. He sold out auditoriums, they had to sometimes add the room next to the room he was in because there was so much desire, huh? To Go to his lectures about sex that they had to like connect radios to other halls to give people enough space to sit down. He was basically a rock star. And again, I think this challenge is a misconception we have about Sexuality that we think of it as this sort of woke thing now that the rainbow flag and all this stuff is sort of this, this modern invention almost. But if you, that's, this is the forties this was happening, people were going to these talks, people were having these conversations and he created something called the Kinsey Scale. And so the Kinsey scale is from zero to six. And he found that it was not useful to apply a binary to people's sexual desires and sexual orientation. It was more useful to put them on a continuum because most people were not exclusively homosexual or exclusively heterosexual. Most people were somewhere in between. And so, so zero was exclusively heterosexual tendencies and six was exclusively homosexual. And he would place people based on all the things they told him somewhere on the scale. And about half of men were somewhere in the middle, not exclusively either. And about a quarter of women. Now think about the time,"

So there's something called a homosocial environment, which has nothing to do with being gay that has to do with being in a situation where you are with people of the same gender as you. So a homosocial environment or things like prisons where you only have men or only have women war, which at that point they just had. And so you have a lot of men who are exclusively in the company of men and maybe looking around going, well now that my options are different, maybe I'm gonna choose from this pool. Anyway, so he found that it was that way around that a lot of people have these fantasies or or actions that they've engaged in. And then there were other researchers, other male researchers who found similar things. And then at some point in the seventies it swapped and it felt like maybe more people, more men were identifying as gay and there maybe less people who were, would've called themselves by. And suddenly this became a thing more for women. So I think that there's some social things going on, there's some research things going on, but actually bi men are have been studied for a long time as well."

And gay, what depends. So if they have what you might refer to as a homosexual lifestyle, so they engage in sort of going to queer parties, maybe go on Grindr or other gay apps, that would be much more a lifestyle thing where you've embraced and you, you see this part of your identity that you are part of this queer community. It's much easier to say you're gay than you are bi most often. Also because there's queer phobia within the queer community. And so you might get gay men saying to a biman, ah, come on, you're act i I was by once. That's a classic. I was by once or Come on, you're actually gay. It's the same that you get the other way around with bi woman. Is that because it's seen as performative, the idea being that bisexual women are doing it for attention, but the attention of men specifically that, well they're all gonna go back to men anyway and they're just doing it. It's a phase. It's this thing that they're doing actually to be sexy to men, not because they're actually interested in women. And so there's this lesbian bi thing going on which is often quite hostile, not always, but often. And there's this gay male bi thing that going on which is different in nature but is also potentially hostile. So in both saying you're bi can be, can be problematic, but for men more so"

So the Klein grid came out of research by Alfred Kinsey and others like Havelock Ellis, but we won't get into him. And Fritz Klein was a male researcher doing research also on bisexuality. He was specifically a therapist and he was looking at people who were struggling with their Sexuality. And so people would show up in the seventies and eighties in his practice and they would say, I'm struggling with my Sexuality. And he would say, how can I help you? And they would say things like, I wish I wasn't interested in men and I'm a man. And he would then work through sort of what that means. Does that mean you don't wanna have these feelings? Does that mean that you don't wanna have these attractions? Does that mean that it's the, the implications of like how your friends and family will see you? That's the problem. And so he created this much more complex scale, which I think is really interesting for everybody to do no matter what their Sexual fetishes, because what it is is it gets you to think about things like, yeah, your sexual identity easy, but it not just that, but in past, present and ideal. And so if you say, well I used to identify as straight, now I identify as bisexual and then I have in my head, this doesn't mean that other people think this in my head, I have an ideal, which could be straight because that's what maybe society's told us we should be, but it could also be something else. And so I've also had friends who've gone, you know, past, present, straight, straight, but ideal bi. So you get into these interesting dynamics where sometimes people just wish they were different Sexuality than they were for other reasons. And then there's other things in the, in the scale that ask about your lifestyle. So for example, if you are in going to parties, queer parties, if you have queer friends, then you might have a homosexual lifestyle even if you're straight. But then again it's how, how would, how much lifestyle would you like? And so for me that was a real moment where I was looking at that going, wow, my lifestyle is really straight and maybe I need to change this. And so he was using these attractions and fantasies and identities and the past present ideal to help people to think through all these complicated feelings we have around our Sexuality and to identify problem like sticking points."

And he'd try to work through it. And the term he used for bisexual people who were uncomfortable in their own Sexuality was being a troubled bisexual. And so I think you can, I think any Sexuality can be troubled. I think you could be a troubled straight person, a troubled homosexual person, a troubled asexual person, and just thinking about why, in which aspects are maybe missing I think is really healthy for people to do."

I think that there are, there's this tendency to assume that Sexual fetishes something that we find and keep and consolidate from our teenage years, maybe early twenties you maybe get university thrown in. So if you get your experimental years in undergrad, but then it, you kinda have to choose. And that is a difficult requirement I think for a lot of people because you can't possibly know all of the things and all the people you might be interested in at that point. And we change in every other way. Why wouldn't we change in this way? So I think giving ourselves also the ability to reappraise where we're at with our own Sexuality, our own desires, our own relationship status, all these things is important to keep us happy and healthy and to not run into issues that we know are faced by a lot of homosexual but also bisexual people. Like research has found that bisexual people are more likely to self harm, they're more likely to be the victims of sexual violence, more likely to be isolated, more likely to be stalked. There's lots of different aspects of being bi that are negative. And the reason for that is mostly because bi people are at least likely to be plugged into the community. So when you're going through stuff like this and you feel different and you're constantly being asked about your Sexuality, if you're open about it or you're hiding it, that's also troubling. You're gonna have these negative consequences, especially if you don't feel like the queer community is really a place for you. So that's where also finding your people really matters."

          "value": "2 (80m 44s):\nSo the reason I included kinks in evil and sexual conversations in general is because it is so often thrown into the same conversation. So if someone comes to me and says, Julia, I want you to help me explain why this person killed this other person. And they'll often say, did you know that he or she was also into insert kink here or insert non-traditional relationship structure here or insert whatever. And I respond to that by going, okay, so, and I think people use these words like, oh he was really into BDSM and think that that's going to have this really important impact on me. Or ooh, they were swingers. And so, and again I go, yeah, that that's you know, almost like, and in other news they were swingers. It's like that is not related to this crime at all unless, you know, one of the partners was killed. But people see this as a defective character and kink is very much seen as a defective character in many circles, especially in sort of broader society. And that is wild to me because if you look at research on sexual fantasies and kinks, a lot of people have at least one. So a lot of people, BDSM being the the most common are engaging in or interested in BDSM. So things like choking or things like restraints or being degraded or doing the degrading of other people in bed consensually of course that is something that a lot of people fantasize about and a lot of people engage in. And so these kinks and these fetishes, they are much more commonplace than we sometimes think about them as. Now on the other hand, we obviously need to be careful not to assume that because in pornography BDSM is almost ubiquitous. It feels that that means everybody wants this. That is absolutely not the case. But we also don't wanna marginalize it and say it's almost nobody. It's, it's somewhere in between. And the main thing is always just to ask and to have open conversations about what it is that people actually want in bed and to make sure you have things like safe wordss. So you know, putting in the restraints to make sure that these interactions are safe and consensual. And then being able to explore. And I mean there's everything from you know, pop play where you dress up as a puppy and you engage in either just general frolicking or sexual behavior to other things like blood play, which is when you pierce the skin to release some sort of blood that can be scratching, that can be cutting, that can be of yourself or your partner. That can be this idea of, you know, I don't know, it's this taboo thing you're doing together and it's sexy in its own way. And so everybody has their own versions of what they find attractive and rubbing up against people, you know, sort of unsuspecting pretending that someone's sleeping. There's, there's this wide range of things and I think people also feel often deeply ashamed about the things that they're interested in. And I think that is also really sad because it makes it more likely that people are going to not be able to live that part of themselves and also that they think there's something wrong with them. And that can spiral into things like am I evil? Am I bad? Am I a bad person? Because they have these fantasies and that ties in unfortunately with homosexuality and bisexuality and the way that certainly historically and in most parts of the world still today, these queer lives and queer identities are still villainized. They're still seen as lesser as bad as a sign of a defective character. And if people see that within themselves, they're going to think differently about themselves and we, well society is going to treat them differently. So it's all about de-stigmatizing."

I mean it's hard to explain why you have a fantasy, but if you go into the finer questions and really dig deep, you can find that people will explain a version of well I can really let go and I don't have to, if someone is telling me what to do, then I don't have to make any decisions and I've spent all day making millions of decisions and I don't have to in this context. And I really like that because it's freeing. And so that's that disinhibition hypothesis is that the reason that we often Go to things in the bedroom that in other contexts we don't like or even find repulsive. Like I don't in normal life potentially wanna be told what to do, but maybe when you move into the bedroom you go yeah, but this is a different context and I kind of want the reverse of what I want in my day-to-day life. And so I can also understand like furries and that's sort of completely living as another species of it even is. It's a really interesting psychological phenomenon of release and of letting go of social pressure."

And that's true whether it's about your Sexuality. So being gay and being unable to live as a gay person or if that's wanting to engage in BDSM and not having an outlet for that. So that can just make you unhappy. So I think that the, the stigma there is that that unhappiness is going to lead to some sort of horrible manifestations of crime. I think that is mostly nonsense, but it's more that I'm concerned about the mental health consequences for the individual who's unable to explore those sides of themselves. And in research on kinks and Sexuality, it's just about also making sure that we have visible representation of certain kinds of communities. And so that's one of the reasons I ended up writing bi. I came out and making evil, making evil's the UK Title Evil in the us. I came out because I was writing about all the things we associate with the word evil and homosexuality certainly is one of those things."

I came out as bisexual and I came out as bisexual in the book and I did it specifically and I wrote it this way as well because I was talking about the importance of visibility and how it's through visibility that you realize that the people around you, people you already know and love are part of this community that otherwise feels other. It feels foreign, it feels abstract and maybe it feels scary, but if you realize that actually you've got gay friends or you've got friends who are into certain kinds of fetishes or you've got friends who are whatever Sexuality sort of aspect you're talking about, you suddenly go, oh it's gonna be much harder to dehumanize these people. And, and this is where all of this kind of comes from me from a really sad place. There's the, you could talk about bi as this project of love and how I was finding the community. I was trying to write something that would sort of bring us all together. But it's also because I'm constantly terrified that my rights are going to be stripped back. And we know that the laws around homosexual behavior and the rights around bisexual people as well, they're in flux. There's no straight line of acceptance. And just because right now I happen to live in a time and place where I'm allowed to be openly bisexual and I can engage in homosexual activity, that doesn't mean that that's gonna stay, not even necessarily in my lifetime. And so I think much like writing evil at a time when you're not at war and you're able to think really prof, you know deeply about these important issues, I think we also need to be thinking about things like Sexuality and other issues that are important to us. And if we wanna preserve our rights, we need to normalize these issues and make sure that they're visible so that people find it harder to dehumanize those communities. And so I'm always terrified that bisexual people are gonna be hypersexualized dehumanized again and that there's gonna be laws against basically just who I am."

So it was really beautiful the the fan mail I got when the sort of responses to the book and they got them from all over the world. And so in the book I also spoke with some researchers who were in like stationed or doing research in countries where bisexual behavior specifically is illegal or homosexual behavior was illegal for a long time. Bisexuality was, especially in women, well actually homosexuality women in general was sort of seen as it was, it was a blind spot because what counted as sex is sex with a penis. And so women can't have sex with one another. And so a lot of laws around homosexuality are specifically applying to men. And certainly historically that's the case. So we're talking about like sodomy and that involves men and not women. And so if you look at the evolution of laws for a while women were kind of like, it was socially not necessarily acceptable, but they were kind of getting away with it legally. But then more recently, especially as bisexuality gets more visible as well, certain countries have started writing it specifically into their constitutions and specifically into their laws that bisexual identities and behaviors are also seen as problematic and illegal. So again, these laws change all the time, but in terms of fan mail, especially from people in countries where homosexuality and bisexuality are illegal or are seen as problematic or socially condemned, that was particularly important so that those people were particularly writing saying something, also saying, can I translate this into this other language on the dl, like on the down low And just like distribute this to my friends, I, I had people sending me messages saying I am at X airport or an X country where this is, this would be considered contraband. Like this book, my book is a banned book. Fun fact."

I think things like the client grid are really helpful, especially for people who are more analytically minded like you and I, I think it gives you a construct to work with and numbers to work with and that can be really helpful to try and go almost seeing your Sexuality as a mathematical equation.

And so I had already published two books. Yeah, I was already an established scientist. I think if I tried by first I a wouldn't have been able to publish the book. It was the first mainstream book on bisexuality ever. And BII don't think I would've been taken seriously as a scientist.

And so that is and was already a huge part of my online experience and actually I think coming out as bi a, you get sort of allies who suddenly are like, we're on your side, we're gonna help you fight sort of the hypersexualization. And people get more, almost more weird about it in a good way. They get a bit quiet about it 'cause they're like, oh well now it's an identity thing so maybe I shouldn't comment on what she's wearing. And it sort of, it almost disarmed some of the more Sexual fetishes comments. So for me I have to say it was mostly a positive experience. The"

Which again is obviously something that then wove its way into my academic work. That's pretty cool. But he was also right, I mean I, I've always been very intellectual. Let's just say I skipped a couple of grades in school. I was part of the chess lab, like it was very much, I was the clever kid. And so, but there's also part of me that's just like, but art is beautiful. I love making art and it can speak to so many people. Anyway, my grandfather convinced me not to do it and then I applied instead for psychology. Although at that point you just had to say social sciences, you didn't have to yet spec specify. But I knew it was probably gonna be psychology. And the reason for that was because my dad has paranoid schizophrenia. And so I think one of the reasons I'm so obsessed with this idea of what is real and, and that is in every way that that, I mean that in terms of what is real in terms of perceptions of right and wrong. What is real in terms of our own memories of the world, what is real in terms of what happened in a crime, what is real in terms of perceptual abilities and neuroscience, what is real? I mean, I mean that on in every way. And I think that's because I grew up with someone who had a unique view of what is real in real time. And so seeing that I think just affected me profoundly because not only was it very destabilizing in terms of my upbringing, but also it's just in your face that people quite literally are seeing and hearing different things than you. And to not jump from that to what else are people perceiving differently than me, I think would be almost like a missed opportunity. And so I went to study psychology partly to understand that and what was going on there. And then that took me down the sort of reality hole. And honestly the reason I went to Criminal psychology because I could've gone into any other, the criminal psychologists were the most, they were the most fun. I feel like lots of psychologists, they took themselves so seriously and I just, I, I couldn't, I was like, I don't, this isn't the vibe. And so the criminal psychologists were, they had this gallows humor, they were doing these like arguably the most serious of the, the crimes in the, in the cases. And yet were somehow having fun and having nice lives. And I saw myself and I went, well I wanna do this version. And so I did."

And the thing that interests me most from a research perspective, I mean I did my PhD in False memories. So implanting False memories of committing crime, which was the study that ended up going viral because I was the first to to do it. And I built on a history of people implanting False memories of various kinds of other emotional events. But it was the first time that someone had combined false confessions research and false memory research. And so that was the research of Elizabeth Loftus and Saul Casson. So false confessions was Saul Casson and False memories was Elizabeth, Elizabeth Loftus. And I was just doing them both at the same time. And the question was could you get people to believe that they committed a crime that never happened and confess to it and not just that, but believe that it actually happened. So remember it. And the answer to that in short is yes you can, especially using specific leading and suggestive interview techniques. And so the procedural learning from that, which is what I'm most interested in, I don't like, that's sort of a party trick to be able to actually do it. And that's just so that you can then take that and go, okay, well how do we prevent this? And so I've since trained police lawyers, I've trained people at the ICC, the International criminal court who deal with collective memories. So they deal with hundreds of witnesses at a time and war crimes. And the question is how do we try to preserve as original as possible memory without contaminating it because well, or at least without contaminating any more than it already is. And that's where social psychology I think excels is that we have done lots of research on how social settings change what people say and to some extent what people believe. And I think that's also where actually the leap to things like AI I think is not far. Because ultimately the way that we're engaging with large language models is that, and generative AI in general is that it, it's structured as a social interaction structure as a conversation most of the time now. And that is what we do. I, that is literally what I train the police on doing is how do we make sure that you don't distort people's memories in the process and how to ask good questions. And so you get confabulation from both sides now you get confabulation from AI and from the people. And the problem is that there's a third thing which is the in-between that I'm not sure is getting enough attention right now. And I wish that there was more integration of social scientists like me and people who do investigative interviewing and have done it for decades to understand what is happening in the in-between and so that we can both teach the people and the AI to respond better in that situation."

We have created a tailored experience of something that is most of the time telling you what it thinks you want to hear And then it's uncritically giving that to you. Or I mean sometimes of course there's, you know, other things where it's sort of appraising whether or not this is truthful or not, but it is giving that to you and there's no safeguard from you just going, this is truth and this is my past or this is how I remembered it. And the problem is, is that not only are is AI potentially distorting people and their memories and nevermind the factual basis on which they're relying. But it's also the other way around is that potentially by asking leading or problematic questions, the people are changing how the AI is creating the content, which is in turn on some fundamental level potentially having an impact on how it's discerning truth from fiction. And so that's where the false memory in human minds and confabulation in AI I think are much more similar than we think. And when I first saw AI confabulate hallucinate, I was like, this is what people do all the time. It's just that we can't fact check them all the time. We're not in a conversation constantly being like, well is that quite right? I'm gonna use that for my homework. Right. So it's ah, just it's both juicy and really troubling."

So this is what we find in investigative interviewing, which is police interviewing of witnesses and suspects, is that all you need is a leading question or a suggestive piece of information in a short interaction. Most people, most police officers don't, don't spend a long time and they don't have no memory of this person's past. They know basically nothing about them except for things related to the crime. And yet we know that within that very short, maybe half hour, one hour interaction, people's stories can change fundamentally. And the problem is that if you create, if you have a memory of something that when you pull it up in that social interaction, it's, it's sort of live, it's like active. And when you then finish that interaction, it sets back down. And the thing is that if you put it back in a different way, what's gonna happen is the next time you're going to remember the latest version and you might not realize that it's shifted. And so over time it can shift and you don't realize it. And that's your truth. And that's where even just short interactions can have a profound impact on the human mind. Wow."

Or if they have multisensory details, they're describing in very specific detail what they smelled, what they heard, what they take, whatever it doesn't mean it's necessarily true. Most of the time our autobiographical memories are good enough and that's where memory scientists talk about this as gist memory are gist memory for events, much like for text, you get the gist of it right? You, you're good enough, you generally remember accurately approximately what happened. But it's when you get to the so-called verbatim details, the specific details of memories that you find, people are often really bad. Now, most of the time that doesn't really matter because you remember you hung out with a friend, you remember you were at this university, you remember approximately what, what your favorite cafe was. You remember this important negative or positive event, fine. You don't actually need to know exactly what you were wearing and drinking and saying. But in a criminal justice setting, you do need to remember exactly what you were drinking and saying and and and doing. Right. And so that's where we have this need to break down this human capacity for memory to this level of detail that it's just not made for."

And so this is where in my research and in research like mine, we've implanted well memories, what we call memories or False memories of experiences that never happened at all. So while most things are modifications of real memories, False memories, complete False memories are when you think you experienced something that you didn't. And we all have them. We all have some memories that can't be true. And we usually realize them. For example, when we talk to our parents about our childhood or when we talk to friends and we say, remember that time we did this? And your friend will go, that happened to me. That didn't happen to you. And you become what is known in research as a memory thief, where you've stolen somebody else's memory and you've accepted it, or your brain has accepted it as your own. And that's possibly because the other person told it in such vivid detail that you could imagine it. And basically your brain was like, well, this feels real now. And so the next time you thought about that, maybe, maybe not the next time, but maybe after a couple of times of thinking about it, you started going, this happened to me. Right? And then you integrated into your autobiography."

And this is widely debated exactly how easy it is to implant a specific false memory. It's also one of the big debates around my own research is that when I was writing the memory illusion, which was my first book, and the research that was in line with that, there was this huge debate between me and a couple of other academics about what it means for something to be a false memory and how we should talk about the ease with which they're implanted. And that is still one of the biggest scientific debates in our field. And to me, I think that's, so the, the, the coding stuff is about the difference between what some people call a false belief and a false memory. So I think this thing happened, or I remember this thing happened. And that is a really difficult differentiation often because all we have as social psychologist is what you're telling me. And I can ask you, do you think it really happened or not? Do you believe it really happened? But it is really hard to differentiate. And so I've always thought that you need to ask people about the specifics. Like, how confident are you in this memory? Do you feel things in this memory? Does it feel like other kinds of me Right, sort of the Nate like, describe the nature of this experience rather than being like, do you think this is a real memory? Because that's, that's a hard thing to ask people to do."

But other people think that it's an easier to differentiate line. So for me, that different, that it's almost impossible to differentiate the two other people think it's more clear. And then in terms of the frequency, so in my research, 70% of people became convinced that they committed a crime that never happened or experienced another important emotional event. And that number as well is, is challenged in that people go, well, does that mean that 70% of people can have False memories like this? And the answer is no, obviously not. That's, that's just in my sample. That's just these specific six False memories. And it could be that I think a hundred percent of people are prone to some version of this, just maybe not in this specific study, right? If I had to come up with different False memories to implant, or if I was a different person myself and people trusted me differently, there's the, again, those social factors that make it more or less likely that I'm going to be able to convince you that something happened in your life that you can't remember. And in one study, obviously I can't capture that. But it also doesn't mean that 70% of the time people are, you know, it might be 1% of the time or 0.1% of the time that people have these complex False"

          "value": "2 (112m 35s):\nI think the, the fact that memory can be false in the way that I do it in my study is it's a result of the fact that our minds are made to creatively recombine information to solve problems in the present. And so even the fact that we have this gist memory, it's because we're optimizing data processing. We're basically saying, these are the most important things from these events, and the other de details are irrelevant. Don't remember that gone. And now I'm gonna work with that to try and solve what life comes up with. And the ability to be creative and intelligent relies on our ability to take memories from the past and pieces of them and to creatively recombine them. And so that's what False memories are, except that that then can look bad if you're trying to remember something specific. And so in my research, I used leading and suggestive questions like, close your eyes, picture the event that I'm trying to implant. So I was implanting, for example, you're 14 years old, you were in contact with the police. The police called your parents and you assaulted someone with a weapon. And then the question is, what do you remember? And you say to me as a participant, because you've been selected out to specifically never having had this experience. And just to be clear a weapon, I don't mean a semi-automatic weapon, I mean anything. And usually it was a rock. And so people would say, I found, 'cause a weapon is just anything you use to hurt another person. And I did the study in Canada, we don't have guns in the same way as in some other parts of the world. And so it was unlikely that my participants would've been like, yeah, I totally have all these guns. And so they would take something, an object and hurt somebody else, or they stole something or they hit somebody. So those are three of the conditions. And I randomly assigned people to them and they knew that I'd contacted their loved ones ahead of time. So they, they, they were participating in a childhood memory study, an emotional childhood memory study. And they knew that. And then I'd contacted their parents ahead of time to get information about what they were like as teenagers, where they lived, friends, basic things, and to make sure they hadn't ever experienced any of the target events. And then with that information, I said to the participants, okay, so there's these two things your parents reported happening and one of them is a true one. And so I'd always include a true one to build rapport, which is I'm doing the what not to do of interviewing. Right? Right. I'm, I'm laying it on thick to see what's possible, to see what's possible because you have to, to push it to also show that it's create that I can do this in this context so that we can warn police to not do this. So I said, we had these two incidents that your parents reported and one of them was you had a skiing accident and blah, blah, blah. Let's start with that one. The second one was an instant where you were in contact with the police. Well, we'll get to that. So we'd first have 20 minutes talking about the true memory, which people, you know, they're, they're getting going. It feels good. I've got a structured interview as well, which I'll then mirror in the false memory. So it all feels very ill, legit. And then we get to the second memory and I say this, you know, I, there's this other important memory that your parents were called. And then they'd say, I don't remember that. And I'd say, oh, okay, but I have this really detailed account. All you have to do is remember it. And then I would do the illusion of transparency, which is a really powerful psychological tool, which is to make people feel like they know what's going on when they don't really. And the thing I would do is just say, well, you know, if you want to, we can do this memory retrieval technique called this imagination exercise. And I don't like to call it repression, but sometimes we hide away memories that we don't like about ourselves. And I'm using words that people know and mechanisms that people have heard of that are frankly quite disputed in actual science. But people go, oh, well maybe I did repress this. And then everybody says yes. Like technically they could say no. They could say no, I don't wanna do that. But they go, yeah, of course I wanna know. And so I do this imagination exercise where people close their eyes very simple and just imagine how, what could have happened basically. And every time they say a detail, my very first detail ever, I remember this because I was so excited because they've got their eyes closed, right? And I'm right next to the head of department because they were worried because I was a PhD student that, you know, the ethics of it, the consequences. Like it took like years to get the protocol through ethics and to make sure it was safe. Anyway, I'm, I'm grinning as the person with their eyes closed says the most trivial detail. I remember a blue sky and I remember Going, it's working."

And those details had to come from them because I dunno enough about their lives, right?

And so just three interviews and you've got 70% of people confessing to crime. That never happened."

And we did in fact cut the city short 'cause we had told ethics that we're only gonna have like a 13% hit rate. And we're like, oh, this is working really well. We're gonna stop. Yeah. So and and that was just because of, you know, how power calculations, whatever science because science and since then there have been other studies on implanting False memories. There have been ones also using AI tools. So like whether or not we remember or think we remember incidents differently or better if they were created with AI images of ourselves or videos. So there was a study that came out I this year inclu by a team including Elizabeth Loftus, which showed that if you turn photos of yourself into videos using ai, that you are more likely to believe that those things happened in the way that AI is telling you that they did. Even though AI has absolutely no idea. And that then you are more likely to remember it with high confidence that it happened in the way that this AI has created it. And so we can see that there's lots of versions of this, whether it's in, you know, interpersonal social interactions or or interactions with tech. And there's a big replication that's happening right now in at the university of Must of my study or it's about to happen hopefully actually is where we're at."

So the first thing that's important is for people to understand that they're capable of creating these False memories and that they're not this really unusual hard to generate thing. That they're actually a normal memory process. And that insight is why I wrote the memory illusion is because I think people need to just understand that their minds work like this and that they're really glitchy when it comes to the accuracy of their autobiographical memories. But again, that that's probably ultimately a good thing as well in terms of our overall human experience. But then what happens if you do have an important piece of information that's important to not being distorted, right? You are a witness of a crime for example, and you now know that this is going to be important. What do you do? And the really simple answer is don't trust your brain. Just make sure you write it down. Assume you are going to forget everything. Assume you're going to forget no matter how important, how emotional, how intense, how much you say to yourself, this is the a failure of prospective memory. It's called, I will remember. You won't just assume that you're not gonna remember. And the closer you get to the time at which an event happened, and we call this contemporaneous evidence, the closer you get in time, the more high quality that memory's going to be. And I think there's this myth sometimes that like if you're drunk or if you're high or if you're really emotional that that's somehow you should wait, you should sort of like, like go home, sleep it off and then recall your memory. That is not what the current advice in memory research actually says. It's in the moment, as soon as possible write it down, record it outside your brain, you can do it again when you wake up. But then at least you have an original version."

So I would always say, so when I trained for example, people who Go to deal with warlords in the German military, I was working with agents who are going abroad and who are in these really difficult situations where they had to remember a lot of information that was important for national security. They couldn't just sit there with a tape recorder being like, hey, or like a phone being like, Hey Mr. Warlord, can you just talk into this a bit closer? You can't do that. And so you have to remember it. And so what they were doing is they were coming back from their deployments and they would meet up immediately and have like a team meeting to be like, what did you remember what happened? And the problem is that they would do that before writing their notes. And that is, that is the wrong way around. And so they don't do that anymore. 'cause I've told them not to do that anymore. But it feels good. It feels like collectively we are going to remember more details because you do. But it doesn't mean that those details are right. And so that's where I'd always say have your own version before you talk to anybody then. And my colleague Dr. Anise Fve is one of the experts on the effect of things like eye closure, on memory and collective memory. And she has found repeatedly that if you remember things together, especially if you've already got an original version of your own, you do usually remember more details. And especially if you are helping each other to remember like in a relationship, you'll have someone who's better at remembering certain kinds of details, maybe names or what happened or what you were doing and the other person's better at when it happened. And so you can have these complimentary memories that come in in social situations and you can then create, have more details that are remembered after."

And so a witness or an alleged victim saying that they, you know, having X story the first time they Go to the police and then three years later having a very different, sometimes categorically different account. And the question is, are they just, were they just too shy initially to say what really happened? Were they, were they under pressure from other people? Were they not really remembering, you know, why has it changed? Or could it be that they have been undergone some really problematic like hypnotherapy or just shady therapy in general that has like convinced them that things were maybe much worse than they initially remembered. And it's not that therapy doesn't necessarily like therapy can bring out more details for sure. But the problem is that certain kinds of therapy mirror what we do in false memory research in terms of implanting False memories. And it just makes it really messy and you just, it it makes the quality of the evidence really low because we can no longer tell what is because of the therapy and what's actually remembered."

So there's a lot of therapy that is evidence-based and that is very much focused on tackling sort of feelings and reactions that you have right now. Then there is a, an area or a bunch of areas of therapy, including psychoanalysis, which are very focused on trying to find retroactively sources of mental illness in your personal past. And I am very critical of the kinds of, well both from an explanatory perspective but also from a false memory perspective. I don't think that we are the way we are because of individual incidents that happened to us. I think that is a wild thing to think about the brain, like to be like you are the way you are because of this one interaction you had that one time is like, I mean maybe this explain is a tiny bit of you, but what about all the other life experiences you have every single day? And so I think that there's sometimes an oversimplified searching for answers or sources of problems that we have that I, I don't like, I don't think it's true. And I think that there can be an uncautious approach to memory as you were saying, where you have someone who is saying things and your role as a therapist is to help them manage their emotions now and to feel better. And that's the other thing is that they have a very different role than I do. The therapist is trying to manage the person's wellbeing now, whereas I am looking at the evidentiary equality that is a complete, I'm almost like not quite the other side, but I'm in a very different role."

If I, you know, look at a past relationships, if I just think about or maybe speak to others about the positive things, really think, just think like I, I focus my mind on the memory, on the positive memories and then everything just becomes more positive and I think it makes me feel like I'm way happier about my past. So there, there must be something to that because I, I almost start to forget that the negative stuff happened. And then the same thing on the flip side is if you focus on the negative, then the, the the negative stuff just overpowers everything else and you have a very heavy negative feeling about your past. So that seems like the way to live a healthy life, a happy life is just to focus on the positive, not to sound cliche, but like, like basically modifying your me memories continuously that everything was just great.

          "value": "2 (130m 5s):\nWell the essence of that is right there is something called state dependent memory, which is that you're more like to remember things that were consolidated or created as memories if, if they match the state that you're in now. So if you are sad now and you your brain sort of just going, you're more likely to remember other sad times because your memory and the emotional state of your brain is basically already activating those networks of sadness and it's like here's some other sad things and shitty things that happened to you. And it's the same with if you are embarrassed. It's, that's the sort of classic one that we usually use as memory researchers is that moment where you do something embarrassing and for the next like six hours all you're thinking of is all the other embarrassing things you've ever done. And it's like your brain is like, would you like some other embarrassing stories? And obviously you're going, no thank you, please stop. But you have this, this spreading activation as it's called of just this synapses just like lighting up new networks and you're going ah, and there's this other memory that's attached to the same feeling. And so it's the same with happiness is that people who are happier tend to remember more happy memories. And so most of the time, unless you're depressed, most people look back at their lives with this sort of rosy reminiscence bias and they're more like to remember the positives than the negatives. But it's not quite the way you were describing it actually. So it's not quite that you only remember the good, the objectively good things that happened. It's more that your interpretation of the things that you've experienced is either neutral or positive. So for me, for example, growing up with my father with parents schizophrenia, that is something that I see as a net positive. So obviously at the time it was experienced in a complicated way, but in hindsight it defined my life and it completely gave me a perspective of the human mind that I just wouldn't have had otherwise. And so I see that as a positive part of my autobiography and that is what good therapy should be doing is it should be taking negative experiences and not overriding them or changing them. I mean our brains do that naturally anyway, but trying to work with what you've got, the experiences, the true experiences, but then just shifting the emotional content so that how you're dealing with them now is, is good."

And he, he then said, well, but you're not gonna be able to remember this. Would you still go? And a lot of people say, no, I, I wouldn't go on that holiday if I can't remember it. I think that's interesting and I think that sort of picks or it didn't happen.

But also thinking about it yourself so you can auto, it's called auto suggestion when you suggest things to yourself that didn't happen and that often comes from reading something or seeing something or thinking about something or hearing somebody else's story and going, does something like that happen to me? And then you start picturing it and thinking about in what context it could have and then you start to basically implant a false memory in yourself. And so that can happen as well. And I think with things like Neuralink, it would be the same where you'd have the ability to do that. And, but again, I I still think that this interaction between humans and ai or AI like systems is, it is the same as a social interaction, which is why I was saying it's so important I think that we have social psychologists in the, in the room because ultimately whether it's an AI or another person, it's the same brain that you're modifying."

Like modified photos is something pre AI that we had that was already messing with people's minds. Even just what you have in the frame of a shot. So if you take a holiday snap and you've, you're emitting like really important part of what actually happened on that holiday 'cause you're taking a picture of the nicest part and not the, you know, the garbage behind you. Yeah. That is gonna have an impact on your memory as well. And so we've, that versions of that have always existed. And historically, if you go even further back, I mean in some ways we've never been closer to facts than we are now. There's this whole idea of like, oh we're living in this post-truth or blah blah blah, but that is not true. I mean, we didn't even know how to write for a long time. We had no way of reliably cataloging information, nevermind the scientific method, nevermind reliably sharing it with one another or fact checking quickly with things like Google. So I mean we're so close to facts, but that in some ways I think is the, the worry is that we've gotten comfortable feeling like we can just access things that aren't modified or that are less likely to be modified and now they're more likely to be and that can interface with our memories."

Usually the negative are the ones we need to work on more. And thinking instead of wow, how terrible was that thinking, what did I learn from that? What is this giving me that other people haven't experienced? What is it that it taught me about? Who are my friends? What do you know? What are these insights that I've won from this experience? And so I think that is an important part of resilience that we ideally need to celebrate and teach more than the opposite, which is hanging in the negatives."

So like someone will say, I do 60%, the other person will say, I do 50% and you add them up. That's more than a hundred percent and that's basically always the case. And on lots of different fronts, people will claim that they do more. And if you ask them how much their partner does, they will diminish it. And so one of the tips I always say for relationships in terms of memories is actually just sharing what you're actually doing. And so if you've initially it feels a bit cumbersome because it's quite unnatural to be like, I've just taken out, you know, the, the rubbish, I've just taken out the bins or I've just booked us a hotel. But saying it out loud means the other person's able to perceive it and then can add it to sort of their internal like star chart of how much you've done in the relationship and they're more like to actually perceive what you're contributing. Whereas we just assume that people have the same memories we do and that they, they of course she remembers that I took out the bins, but not necessarily, she might not even have really perceived it. But if you're reminding each other of all the things that you're doing, it can feel more balanced over time."

And there are now some really good brain training apps as well that can help to get people to work better with attention to have end back tests. So remember information, a couple of information pieces of information back. So what did I tell you three sentences ago? There's all of these kinds of, well games effectively that you can play that will in fact train how your brain is using its networks. There was one that was developed by researchers, including researchers at the University of Bon in Germany and it's called Neuro Nation. And that's one that I like because it's all these really short games and the idea is that doing one thing like Sudoku or whatever those sort of classics to train your brain, that is only going to be useful up to a point because it's then the same thing over and over again. And what you wanna be doing is lots of different kinds of tasks that your brain has to remain flexible. And so short and many is the answer rather than one thing hard. It's almost the opposite of expertise."

Allegedly there are tricks and it's mostly to make the information more sticky by making it a bigger network in the brain. And so usually when you hear a name, especially like you and I, it's like gone immediately. Yeah. And that's partly because I'd like to think the positive of that is because we're focusing on other things about the person, right? Like what do they, like, what do they, you know, what's this next interaction going to be? Maybe you're a bit nervous about what they're gonna say or what you're gonna say. You're already thinking a step ahead in terms of interpreting the situation. And it's quite an overwhelming situation when you first meet somebody 'cause there's a lot to take in. And so if however a name is important, then you need to a remember to focus when they actually say their name and tune out the other stuff, which could be really difficult. And then to give yourself a monic of, how do I remember this name? So you could have a, a visualize something, you could have a a weird name like word game or some sort of like rhyme that you create for the person. You can say, you know, Julia with big ears. Like whatever works for you as long as it sticks. Now there's a caveat that I recently discovered about myself and to in terms of why I might not have, I have particularly bad memory for names. All of these mnemonic devices that have been studied over the last hundreds of years mostly rely on creating elaborate pictures in your mind. So like memory champions, people who do competitive remembering will tell you that they create these really elaborate images in their heads. I recently discovered that I have aphantasia aphantasia is the inability to create mental imagery. And so when I was trying these techniques, I was going, none of these are working for me. And it turns out it's because I don't see anything whereas other people actually see pictures in their mind. And so I think there's some individual differences stuff going on there that we haven't quite understood."

          "value": "2 (145m 39s):\nThe book Green Crime is really an experiment for me in whether we can apply criminological and Criminal psychology ideas to the area of environmental protection and, and crimes. Because there are people who are convicted of crimes, who are convicted of crimes specifically in relation to destroying the earth and are natural resources or shared resources. I sometimes think about the earth as like a house. And if someone was coming into your house and just setting things on fire and then walking out unpunished, you'd be really upset and correctly so, or poisoning your water or just like leaving a bunch of garbage all over your house. And that's what people are doing on a planetary scale. And the question is, are we responding effectively? And if so, who, who is responding effectively? And then what is the adequate punishment? How should we deal with the people who we, who we catch? And so in this book, the question was are the people who are, for example, I use the the Dieselgate Volkswagen case, which was all about lying about the emissions that were being produced by diesel cars, especially in the United States. And so Volkswagen for 10 years produced these cars that had what was called a defeat device, which is a specific device that makes it look like the cars don't emit very much nitrous oxides. But they actually were way over the legal limit for pollution. Now, why we should care about nitrous oxides is because there is no limit of no like bottom limit of nitrous oxides that is healthy for the, the human lung. So basically any amount is bad for you. And it's related to things like asthma. It's related to things like premature death. It's related to all kinds of negative immediate health effects. And this is what was being pumped outta these cars at wildly high rates, 40 times the legal rates in some cases. And they just lied about it. They just covered it up. They knew they didn't. Well some, some of the people, there's a big debate within the Volkswagen, people who've been convicted, A lot of people say, I didn't really know I'm being scapegoated. Fine. People knew the question how much and who that's up for debate. But certainly people knew 'cause they had to create the thing, like they had to literally create this piece of software to put into the cars. And then when they got caught, they lied about it and eventually the truth came out. But it was like 10 years later. And so the question is, what leads people, clever people, these aren't idiots. These are like clever engineers who are literally working on emissions. Like they know exactly what these emissions do to people. They know exactly how harmful they are, what leads people like that to lie about it, to create these things and to, and to continue lying when they are caught. And so that is one of the cases I, I cover in it and I'm looking at it more as a case study for this kind of crime, which is the sort of corporate collective crime and the lying and just what leads people in these settings to lie and to cover up each other's crimes and to conform to these new norms, these harmful environmental norms. And so I look at it in that way. And then in other chapters I look at like people go undercover and uncover poaching gangs. And there it's some somewhat procedural where it's more, I didn't know that there were undercover agents infiltrating poaching gangs. I didn't know that Interpol was involved in all of these kinds of environmental crime. And how, and it gets quite exciting in some of these cases where you really see the people who are trying to hold people accountable."

          "value": "2 (149m 17s):\nSo what I found most interesting in researching for Green Crime. So I was speaking to people from the United Nations who were doing these huge research reports on things like the international trafficking and wildlife crime. I was talking to people who were infiltrating at the EIA, the Environmental Investigation Agency. It's like the sort of undercover police of the earth. And they're infiltrating these organized crime groups, these gangs that are involved in poaching and other activities. I was talking to this Interpol agent and it's, I think all of these people were talking about very different ways of measuring environmental crime and of responding to it. And so depending on who you talk to, the answer will be very different. How do we fight crime? And the answer is also very different potentially than in other kinds of crime that are more commonly discussed like violent crime. So initially when I started trying to apply Criminal psychology to these really big crimes of that are often also multilevel where you've got bosses, you've got the, whether it's a corporate boss or a an illegal gang boss, you've got the middlemen, you've got the people on the ground who actually have the guns who are killing people or animals or are logging or polluting. And then you've got sort of all these levels of people. And that makes it very different from the kinds of crimes that we often talk about in other kinds of true crime, for example, where it's sort of one person, maybe a couple of people against one other person or a couple of other people. And so the scale is so tiny normally, and it's mostly violent crime, which is mostly it's arguments, it's bad decisions. It's people who are frankly often quite vulnerable themselves, like substance, using people with mental health problems. People who are sleeping rough like the, these are not healthy normal people most of the time who are perpetrating bad crimes. And yet in this context, in environmental crime, this is why I couldn't apply the research directly, you've got some of the smartest people in the world who are still engaging in fraud, who are engaging in the coverup of financial information, who are creating shell companies in order to hide certain things for poaching. The proceeds of poaching. You've got people who are out there illegally fishing and someone's insuring the vessel that has been literally registered by Interpol as a criminal vessel for 10 years and someone's going, I'll insure that. And so you've got these really complicated other factors going on. But I thought that's what was so interesting is ultimately stripping back each layer of each of these crimes and going, who is that person? Who is the person who is insuring this? Who is the person who is out there engaging in illegal fishing on the boat? Who is the person who's financing the boat? Who is the person who's investigating the right? And so looking at all the different levels and I think that's where you get some clarity. And actually at the end of the book, for me, I felt so optimistic I went into Green Crime because I, like most people in the world, at least according to a recent UN climate survey, something like 85 to 90% of people in the world think about the climate crisis on a regular basis. Most people think about it every single day. This idea that there's this like minority of people who care about climate change, that's an illusion that's not true. And if you ask people what the emotional consequences are of those feelings, it's people say things like eco anxiety, anger, sadness, grief, that we're, you know, we're worried about the future. But what you want is for people to feel motivated, energized, purposeful about tackling. One of the biggest issues of our time, and certainly by meeting all of these UN researchers by, I went to so many conferences, you, you have no idea how many conferences I went to. I went to anti-corruption conferences, I went to wildlife time conferences, I went to the specific meeting of multilateral agreements to see how like people were negotiating in the room and the tensions between it, it was wild. It's so interesting. It's such a huge space and it gave me so much hope for the future."

I was at a a European Space Agency conference recently and they're telling us all about the different satellites that are imaging sort of pointing at the earth rather than out into space. And that are imaging through all these different wavelengths exactly what's changing. And basically just chronicling how the earth has changed over time. And a lot of these environmental crimes can be seen from space and can be measured. And so it's like as long as you trust those data, the question then is, okay, these crimes are happening, how do we stop them? And as you say, like I was very much trying, I mean you can't write a book on environmental issues and be apolitical. I think that's impossible. But I certainly was trying to look at it quite logically and go, here's a crime. We all agree this is bad. And they're, these are people who've been convicted. This isn't just like someone who didn't do the recycling. Because also I think that individual level is often detrimental, but these are huge, huge crimes that cost us a huge amount of money to clean up and that cost a huge amount of human health and you know, have these other knock on effects. And our changing certainly the structure of our planet in a way that we can feel already. And so that is the purpose of the book, is to try and show that we actually have lots of laws already. We've got lots of enforcers, we've got lots of researchers on it from space and not space looking at these issues, tracking them and trying to hunt down the criminals. So"

So doing what you think everyone else is doing or know what everyone else is doing. So there's an industry where you know that lots of people are cheating or are fudging the facts in some way, then you both feel the need. And also maybe rationalize the ability to also deceive because it's market forces, right? Like ultimately in a free market or even a controlled one, you've got these people who are just lying to everybody else and they're saying, we're getting to these X outcome by following the rules that everyone else is. And they're not. They're just lying to consumers. They're lying to the regulators, they're lying, they're just lying. And then other people who are trying to be honest and you know, play the game clean, they see the success of this other company and go, well we, we want to have what they have. And then they realize they can't with the tech that exists get there. And so what do they then realize is, well they must be cheating. And so then they start cheating. And so it has this trickle effect of making everyone else fall in line with these well unethical practices that are unethical on so many levels. And then later you get these huge lawsuits because if it, you know, you get caught, then everyone's upset. The investors are upset, the consumers are upset, the environmentalists, the lawyer, everybody's upset with you because you have committed this huge crime."

And that's why also in the book, I always focus on, whistleblower is a big word, but like people who at some point actually helped to uncover what was going on. And that if we're back to the topic of heroes, we're back to bystander effects, we're back to all of the social psychology and Criminal psychology that we've been talking about this whole time. Which is why I thought it was so important to apply that research to this context and to say, okay, so now we've got these people who are willing to engage in these crimes. They know it, but there's also this moment of how do you get out of it and who is going to stop them? And back to the idea of heroes, and you do usually in these cases at some point have a hero, either an external one or an internal one who goes, this needs to stop."

But I mostly get to benefit from other people's research that I summarize into my books. And I think that, I think that the tech that we are now experiencing mostly also gives me hope in that there is this whole new frontier of capacity to implement scientific findings if we want to do so and choose to do so. Like also even in memory interviewing, we were talking about the potential role of AI in distorting our memories. I, when I do talks, when I do corporate talks, I tell people the prompt that I use to use the cognitive interview, which is the best practices in memory interviewing, because you can also tell, you know, AI tools to do the appropriate kind of interviewing if you're talking about memory things. And I created a company called Spot of in 2017, which uses, well it's, we're now building it out to be ai, but it's basically a tool to record important emotional memories and to share them as information with others. So that, I've always been interested in how tech can help us to record important emotional events like with Spot Talk, the Spot and how technology can actually make us feel more human. So there's these capacities, like memory that we're bad at, and tech can help us to overcome some of those shortcomings as long as we use it in a science backed way rather than just sort of free styling. I think the worry I have sometimes is that, as I've said before, we're sort of ignoring the social scientists entirely sometimes when building these systems and it ends up becoming this engineering math problem when that's not actually in terms of the consequences for humanity, what it's going to be. And so I'm always keen on connecting social science isn't big issues."

And so I, I went to a, well, I did a TED Talk and I was invited to this tech conference called Founders Forum, which is this sort of meeting of tech founders and others in London, but in also a couple other places. And I was invited to this and while there I met the founder of Evernote, Phil Libin. Cool. And so I met Phil Libin at this event and I was talking to him about my research on memory and how I've been wanting to implement or translate what I've been doing into something that could prevent False memories. And specifically I was interested in creating a, an AI or at least machine administered version of the cognitive interview. So that's the neutral approach. It's already a scripted approach, which was helpful. So it's been scripted for decades or a couple of decades. It's been scripted for decades as a cognitive interview. And when we train police on how to do it in places like the uk, it's literally just asking people to basically read a script that we have fine tuned over the years. And what can do that really well? Well Chatbots can do that really well. And so together with Phil Libin and my two co-founders, Dylan and Daniel, I ended up co-founding Spot, which is talk to spot.com if you wanna check it out. And it ended up sort of pivoting into this general reporting tool for workplaces where this was before me too. But it was the idea being that in lots of workplace environments, you have important emotional events that are really important to understand, but are really hard to preserve. And often you have this really bad evidence that you're relying on. So someone at some point sort of goes to HR and says something and somebody else says something else, and you're sort of unsure as a company maybe who to whom to trust, what's real. And so we were trying to streamline that. And so now SPOT is a reporting tool for any kind of compliance issues. And so you can talk to Spot it's called and it's is this chat bot interface that administers the cognitive interview and then creates a report that then gets sent if you want to your employer. So we work with like insurance companies, medical companies, we work with the bar. So all the lawyers in the UK use it themselves, which I always think is a real stamp of approval when the bar council's using your tool. Nice. But again, not, not bars and drinks, bars and lawyers. Yes."

          "value": "0 (0s):\nThe following is a conversation with Pavo Durov, founder and CEO of Telegram, a messaging platform actively used by over 1 billion people. Pavo has spent his life fighting for freedom of speech building tools that protect human communication from surveillance and Censorship. For this, he has faced pressure from some of the most powerful governments and organizations on earth. In the face of this immense pressure, he has always held his ground continuously fighting to protect user privacy and the freedom of all of us humans to communicate with each other. I got the chance to spend a few weeks with him and can definitively say that he's one of the most principled and fearless humans I've ever met. Plus, when I posted that I'm hanging out with Paval, a lot of people, fans of his wrote to me asking if he does in fact privately live the disciplined aesthetic life he's known for No alcohol, stoic mindset, strict diet and exercise, including a crazy amount of daily pull-ups and pushups. No phone except to occasionally test telegram features and so on. Yes, he's 100% that guy, which made the experience of hanging out with him really inspiring to me. I'm grateful for it and I'm grateful to now be able to call him a friend. This podcast conversation is in parts philosophical about freedom life, Human Nature, and the nature of government bureaucracies. And it is also impart super technical because to me it's fascinating that Telegram has a relatively small engineering team and yet is able to basically out innovate all of its competitors with an insane rate of introducing new, unique features. Just like the meme of the Simpsons did it. First, you consider all the features we know and love in our communication apps. In almost every case, telegram did it first. So we discuss it all from the Kafkaesque situation. He's in the midst of in France, to the rollercoaster of his life and career to his philosophy on technology freedom and the human condition. And by the way, while this entire conversation is in English, we'll make captions and voiceover audio tracks available in multiple languages, including Russian, Ukrainian, French, and Hindi. If this is of interest to you, you'll need to head over to the Lex Friedman channel on YouTube, or you can switch between language audio tracks by clicking the settings gear icon, then clicking audio track, and then selecting the language you prefer. Here we only provide the original English version, and now a quick few second mention of response, check them out in the description or@lexfriedman.com slash Sponsors. It is in fact the best way to support this podcast. We got Miro for team collaboration masterclass for learning UPLIFT desk for my favorite office desks, fend for customer service, AI agents, element for electrolytes, and Shopify for selling stuff online.

To get in touch with me For whatever reason, Go to l freeman.com/contact. Alright, let's go. This episode is brought to you by a new sponsor, Miro. It's an Online collaborative whiteboard platform. You know, like for brainstorming ideas together with your team except on the interwebs, they have this space called the innovation workspace that blends AI and humans human creativity to develop ideas. So this is for multiple people, so it enables teams to brainstorm, prototype, and iterate fast on the ideas. I think a really big part of a successful team is being able to brainstorm. Each individual person in a self-motivated way is coming up with ideas, but then those ideas are put into the same kind of system where they can be integrated and the tension between those ideas can develop even better ideas. And so you go and go and go and constantly improve. So I think Miro is a really nice platform for that brainstorming process. Help your teams develop great ideas into results with Miro. Go to Miro dot com to find out how. That's MIR o.com. This episode is also brought to you by masterclass and there are new class called The Power Playbook, how to Win at Work. It's actually a masterclass by a super strong and popular professor from Stanford, Jeff Peffer. He has a lot of excellent lectures and books that study power. And this masterclass is a sort of an applied study of power. It provides a playbook that breaks down the rules of power and teaches you ways how they can be applied in the workplace. It's like the Game of Thrones, but in the 21st century capitalist system. There you go. It's basic communication, body language, all that kind of stuff. How to position yourself. So there you get a promotion, figuring out how to be influential. I started listening to this masterclass and it's excellent. I highly recommend, it's called The Power Playbook, how to Win at Work.

This episode is also brought to you by Element, my Daily Zero sugar and delicious electrolyte mix. That brings me a lot of joy. I drink it in the morning, I drink it in the afternoon, I drink it in the evening, sipping on it right now. I started doing a thing that makes my life significantly in a small way, but it feels big better when I Go to hard training sessions that go for, you know, 90 minutes to two hours on the mat jujitsu, you know, round after round after round for a long time. I usually prefer not to have much water just so I can focus on the training. You know, every once in a while I'll Go to the water fountain, that kind of stuff, but bringing a cold bottle of water with a packet of watermelon salt element in it. It's just that little break of sipping on this drink that I've come to associate with home and it's, it's a little bit cold in the Texas heat. I don't know, it's just such a cool feeling. It's a good feeling, it makes me feel happy. You get a free eight count sample pack for free with any purchase if you try it@drinkelement.com slash lex. And finally, this episode is brought to you by Shopify, a platform designed for anyone to sell it anywhere with a great looking online store. I built 20 minutes at LEX dot com slash store and have a few shirts on there. They're constantly upgrading every aspect of Shopify. It's kind of incredible. Now I heard that they've upgraded fulfillment. So everything you need to ship stuff, if you're selling stuff online, you gotta ship it most of the time. And all of that is now built into Shopify. We already know that you can sell stuff online with Shopify, but again, the thing I'm gonna keep talking about, which makes it incredible is that Shopify is this super scalable cloud infrastructure originally in large part to build on Ruby on Rails and huge brands used Shopify Plus for enterprise grade scale. I'm also reading here that Shopify can support headless commerce. So you can use Shopify just on the backend and then do your own front end completely using React view and next js. What do you know? Sign up for a $1 per month trial period at shopify.com/lex. That's all lowercase. Go to shopify.com/lex to take your business to the next level today. This is the Lex Freeman podcast to support it.

And I could see that a society without freedom cannot enjoy the abundance of opinions, of ideas, of goods and services. Even for a four or 5-year-old kid, it was obvious like you can't experience all the toys, the ice cream of sorts, the cartoons in the Soviet Union that you can access in Italy. And then I got to realize something even more important. You don't get to contribute to this abundance without freedom. And at this point it was pretty obvious to me."

And there he would describe the biological and chemical processes that happen in your body once you consume the or that substance. It was mainly related to illegal drugs, but alcohol was one of these addictive substances that he covered. So it turns out that when you drink alcohol, the thing that happens is that your brain cells become paralyzed. They become literally zombies. And then next day, sometime after the party is over, some of your brain cells die and never get to normal. So think about this, if your brain is this most valuable tool you have in your journey to success and happiness, why would you destroy this tool for short term pleasure? This sounds ridiculous."

We are scared that we won't become accepted anymore, which thousands of million years ago meant we're going to starve to death. So we have to consciously fight this inclination to be agreeable with everything that the majority imposes on you. Because it's quite clear that many things that the majority in many activities the majority is engaging in are not bringing you any good."

But if you are doing something that everybody else is doing anyway, what's the value of it now? It sounds easier than it is done to do something that nobody else is doing because we humans are surrounded by all kinds of information, which makes us want to copy what we're perceiving. At the same time, there are so many areas which you can explore that have nothing to do with the information you receive on the daily basis. So it's extremely important to curate the information sources that you have so that you wouldn't be somebody who is left to the will of AI based algorithmic feed telling you what's important so that you end up consuming the same information, the same stuff, the same memes, the same news as everybody else, but rather you should be proactive. You should deliberately try to set a goal, an area that you want to explore, and then actively search information that is relevant to this field so that one day you can become the world's number one expert in this field. And it's not quite, it's not that difficult to do that. You have to just remain consistent because nobody else is trying to do that. Everybody else is just reading the same news and discussing the same news every day, but this way they don't get to have a competitive advantage."

They say, well you have to take a sleeping pill. But I never take pills. I love this moments. I get so many brilliant ideas, or at least they seem brilliant to me at the moment while I'm lying in bed, either late in the evening or early in the morning. That's my favorite time of the day. Sometimes I go, I wake up, I go take a shower still without a phone. Beautiful ideas can come to you while you are doing your morning exercise, your morning routine without a phone. If you open your phone first thing in the morning, what you end up being is a creature that is told what to think about for the rest of the day. Same is true in a way if you've been consuming news from social media late at night. But then how do you define what is important and what you really want to become in life? Now, I'm not saying you have to completely stay away from all sources of information, but take some time to think about what's really important for you and what you want to change in this world."

And you're supposed to be really connected conclusion very early is that the more connected and accessible you are, the less productive you're. And then how can you run this thing if, if you're constantly bombarded by all kinds of information, most of which is irrelevant to the success of what you're trying to build. You know the entire world can be fascinated by a fight, a quarrel between the world's richest man and the world's most powerful man. But for the vast majority of these people following this saga, it's irrelevant. It won't change their lives. And in any case, they can't affect it. So it's a bit pointless. Of course there are people who are engaged in activities that require them to be up to date of of everything that's going on, but 99% of people aren't."

What is the thing that's happening today that's still going to be true in 10, 20 years? And from that, decide what you're going to do.

Some of them are not very pleasant, but I believe that it's the responsibility of every one of us To cope with these emotions and to learn to work through them. Self-discipline is particularly important because without it, how can you overcome this seemingly endless loop of negativity or despair that ultimately leads to depression for some people, I normally never have depression. I don't remember having depression in the last 20 years, at least maybe when I was a teenager. Reasons for is I start doing things, I identify the problem, I can see a solution and I start executing the strategy. If you are stuck in this loop of being worried about something, nothing's ever going to change. And people often make this mistake thinking, oh, I should just have some rest and then regain energy. This is not how it works. You gain energy by doing something. So you start doing something, then it happens. You feel motivated, you feel inspired, and then ultimately you do something else a little bit more, a little bit more, and then a few years who know you may end up achieving great things."

But it's similar to pretty much every activity. You get to write some code, write a small piece of code first, and then you get inspired, then you'll come up with more ideas. You need to write a novel or just write a paragraph. This is pretty obvious and not a secret.

Most of the days squats are particularly boring. They're not that hard, they're just boring. But you overcome it and then it's much easier to start doing other things related to your work. For example, when I can, I also take a nice bath because it's another exercise of self-discipline. I think the main muscle you can exercise is, is this muscle, the muscle of self-discipline, you know? No, not your biceps or or or your pecs or anything else because if you get to train that one, everything else just comes by itself"

But it is done in a way that maximizes heat and they also use all kind of herbs and branches and It's a much more holistic and natural experience then necessary part of it is you get the cold plunge and then you go back and again, this is one of those things that maybe in the moment is not always that pleasant, particularly if you Go to extreme temperatures, you don't feel great. I don't always feel great, but this feeling is passing, it's only a few minutes. Same with the ice bath. You have to suffer a bit and then you get to feel great for hours and days after. What's more, it gives you this long-term health benefits in a way you can look at it as alcohol, in reverse alcohol will give you this short fleeting pleasure for an hour for a couple of hours, but then you will be paying for it with long-term negative consequences. I'd rather do binna in ice spot."

You are reluctant to do it, but you swim for 10 minutes and then for 20 minutes and then for 30 minutes and teaches you this incredible patience that I think is necessary if you want to achieve anything in life."

I didn't panic at that moment and there were worse swims I had that were shorter but involved accidents and you know about some of them. So that wasn't the worst by far. But an important thing about swimming and physical activity in general is that it makes your mind clear and your thinking process is becoming more efficient because at the end of the day, the efficiency of our brain is limited by how much sugar and oxygen our heart can push through blood. To our brain though, how can you make this go faster or how do, do you make your lungs more efficient? How do you make your heart more efficient in doing that? The physical activity is the only way I know of. So it's not just staying healthy or trying to look good, it's also being productive. It's also being stress resilient. All of these qualities are necessary if you want to run a large company, if you want to start a company. I'm surprised when I started doing this more than 10 years ago, that more CEOs didn't engage in sports. The situation changed in the last several years, which is great because back in the day, if you take 20 years ago, there was this stereotype that if you are strong, you must be not very smart and vice versa, which is a complete lummi. Very often these two things go together."

So if you wanna stay efficient and healthy, why consume processed sugar? You'll just end up snacking all the time. Intermittent fasting. So say eating only within six hours and not eating for 18 hours every day. Also brings structure into your day and into your eating habits. So you don't crave sugar anymore because you know if you eat sugar and then you're unable to snack, you're just punishing yourself. I read a few books on longevity. I think something everybody agrees on is that sugar is harmful. No, I'm not militant about sugar. Like you can eat various fruit if you feel your body needs it, but it's not true to think it's necessary to consume sweet things. Not for children, not for adults. Red meat, I stopped eating it about 20 years ago because I just felt heavy every time I had it. So I guess it's individual, it's my metabolism, my digestive system isn't agreeing with with with this kind of food. So I normally see food of all kinds and vegetables. This is the basic source of calories for me."

If you experiencing a headache, one solution would be to take a pill and then the headache disappears. What this pill would actually do, in most cases it would mute the consequence, your feeling of pain, it's a painkiller, it'll not eliminate the root cause. So you have to ask yourself what is it that's causing this headache? Do I need to drink some water? Is the air quality here bad? Do I need to start getting more sleep? Is there something wrong with people around me? There's stressing me out. There must be some reason why you're experiencing a headache, but if you take a pill, you're not removing this reason, you're actually making it worse because this harmful factor is still there. It's like you're piloting a helicopter and there is some red signals and red lamp starts to blink and, and it starts producing bad, unpleasant noise. What would you do? You would try to figure out the cause and eliminate it. Maybe there is some bounding next to you and you have to avoid it or you take a hammer and smash the signal. I think the answer is quite obvious. So why are we constantly doing this regardless? Oh, because everybody else is doing it. Because there's a whole industry trying to persuade you that this is the right thing to do. So it's incredibly important to analyze yourself and try to get to the bottom of things."

One of the ways to achieve freedom of thought is to remove your mind from the influences, the forces that manipulate you. That's really important to realize the the content you consume, especially on the internet, when a large percentage of it is designed to manipulate your mind. You have to disconnect yourself, be very proactive, understanding what the biases, what the incentives are so you can think clearly independently and objectively."

If you have too many people, they have to coordinate their efforts constantly communicate and 90% of their time will be spent on coordinated the small pieces of work they're responsible for between each other. The other problem with having too many employees is that some of them won't get enough work to do and if they don't get enough work to do, they demotivate everybody else by their mere existence. They're still there, they're still getting the salary, but they don't do anything. And if they don't do anything more often than not, they will start trying to find their purpose elsewhere, maybe inside your team, but not by doing productive work, but by finding problems that don't exist within the team. And that can disrupt the team and the mood inside it even further. Also, when you intentionally don't allow some of your team members to hire more people to help them, they'll be forced to automate things. In our case, we have tens of thousands of servers around the world, almost a hundred thousand distributed across several continents and data centers. If you try to manage this system manually without automation, you will probably end up hiring thousands of people, tens of thousands of people. But if you rely on algorithms and the team is forced to put together algorithms in order to manage it, then it becomes much more scalable, much more efficient, and interestingly much more reliable as well"

That's why since 2012 when we've been trying to come up with this design, we always invested a lot of effort into making sure that nobody can mess with it. Like if you hire an employee or any of the existing employee, it can't break the system in a way that would allow them to access messages of users. And then of course we launched end to an encrypted messaging that is even more protected, but it's has certain limitations, so you still have to rely on Encrypt Cloud. So an interesting engineering challenge was how you make sure that no point of failure can be created within your team or outside,"

I always had issues with my teachers because I would point out their mistakes during classes. And at the end of the day, what's important is to remind yourself that you have nothing to lose. Like they can think they, they blackmail you with something, they can threaten you with something, but what is it that really can, can really do to you? Like worst case they can kill you. But that brings us back to the first part of our discussion. There's no point living your life in fear. As for Telegram, it's incredibly successful, but if we lose one market or two markets or pretty much all of the markets, I don't care that much. It won't affect me, it won't affect my lifestyle in any way. I will still be doing my pushups, you know, so yeah,"

I think the right to privacy is included in the constitution of most countries, at least most western countries. But it's still under attack almost every week. And it often starts with well-meaning proposals, but we have to fight crime, we have to do that, we have to protect the children. But at the end of the day, the result is the same. People lose their right to such fundamental thing as privacy. They sometimes lose their right to express themselves to assemble. And this is a slippery slope that we witnessed in pretty much every autocratic country or country that used to be free and then became auto autocratic. No dictator in the world ever said, let's just strip you away from your rights because I want more power to myself and I want you to be miserable. They all justified it with very reasonable sounding justifications. And then it came in stages gradually and after a few years people would find themselves in a position when they're helpless, they can't protest. Every message they sent is monitored, they can't assemble, it's over."

They would naturally be inclined to increase the level of influence, to have more subordinates, to have more resources. And that's how you end up in an endless loop of, you know, ever increasing taxes, ever increasing regulation, which ultimately just suffocates free market, free enterprise and free speech. So you do want to have very, very strict limitations on the extent the government can increase its powers at the expense of citizens. Ironically, you don't have those limitations you're supposed in, in all countries of which are considered to be free. It's supposed to be the constitution that protects everybody, but interestingly it doesn't work always this way. They are able to find very tricky phrasings in order to cover out exceptions and then the exception becomes the rule."

They read me a list of something like 15 serious crimes that I'm accused of, which was mind boggling at first. I thought there must be some mistake. Then I realized they're being serious and they're accusing me of all possible crimes that the users of Telegram have allegedly committed or some users and they think I should be responsible for this. Which again, like you said, it's nothing. It's something that never happened in the history of this planet. No country, not even an authoritarian one did that to any tech leader, at least at this scale. There are good reasons for that because you are sacrificing a big part of your economic growth by sending this kind of messages to the business and tech community. So they put me in a police car and I found myself in police custody, small room, no windows, just a narrow bed made of concrete. I spent four day, almost four days there in the process I had to answer some questions of the policemen. They were interested in how Telegram operates. Most of it is public anyway. And I was struck by very limited understanding, or should I say even lack of understanding on behalf of the people who initiated this investigation against me by how technology works, how Encryption works, how social media work."

There's a story literally about the situation that he wrote, perhaps predicted called the trial where a person is arrested for no reason that anybody can explain and is stuck in the judicial system for a long time. That nobody fascinatingly in that story. Neither the person arrested nor the sys, any individual member of the system itself fully understand what is happening. Nobody can truly answer the questions and eventually the person spoiler alert is mentally broken by the whole system, which is what bureaucracy can do in its most absurd form is it breaks the spirit, the human spirit laden in all of us.

There's a nice page, telegram.org/moderation that shows just the incredible amount of groups and channels that are engaged in terrorist activity and cs, a activity that are blocked, actively blocked, found and blocked by Telegram. So, and a lot of this work, like you said, because of the automation is done with machine learning, just the scale is insane. This is stuff that most like Nobe like me who are just chatting it up on Telegram, don't think about, there's just like an immense number of people essentially doing things that violate the law on there and you have to find them immediately and catch it. I guess all platforms have to deal with it and Telegram was doing a great job of dealing with that kind of content.

In any case, you're right. I mean if, if you look at Telegram, we've been fighting harmful content that is publicly distributed on our platform since 10 years ago, actually, since the time we launched public channels on Telegram and since something like eight years ago, we had daily transparency reports on how many channels related to child abuse or terrorist propaganda. We've taken down daily. Every day we've taken, maybe we take down hundreds of them and if you include all kinds of content that we remove, all the accounts, groups, channels, posts that would amount to millions of pieces of content every week, hundreds of thousands, every day. And then somebody would read the newspaper get enraged because they would read something about child porn. And this is a subject that is very emotionally charged and start doing something not based on data and logical thinking and laws, but based on emotions driven from inaccurate input."

And in France it's not just the police or prosecutor asking me questions, it's a judge, Which in my experience is more like still a prosecutor, but it's called a judge and that makes it harder to appeal. So if you are limited in say, countries where you can travel then to appeal, that restriction will take you a lot of time. The investigation itself should have never been started. It's an absurd and harmful way of solving an issue such com as complicated as regulating social media, it's just the wrong tool. So we objected and appealed the investigation itself, we did last year. I believe we're still not even given a hearing date for the appeal because the process is painfully slow, not just for me but for everybody. Which made me realize the system may be broken in many levels. You have other entrepreneurs affected by the French justice system telling me horror stories about their experiences where businesses got paralyzed by very unnecessary actions of investigative judges that ended up being unjustified and biased. And in the end you can perhaps solve it when you reach a higher court and you'll get justice, but you'll lose a lot of time and energy in the process. So this is the only thing that is, I hope different and will be different in this case compared to the story you told from Kafka."

Please, during this four days in police custody, when you stuck, unable to communicate with people that are important to you when you don't even know what's going on in the world in relation to you personally. So I have no crystal ball that would tell me the future. I can't say that I am pessimistic.

And not only I refuse, I told the world about it. And I'm gonna keep telling the world about every instance. Any government in, in this case in particular, the French government tries to force me to do anything and I would rather lose everything I have and the yield to this pressure. Because if you submit to this pressure and agree with something that is fundamentally wrong and the it violates rights of other people as well, you become broken inside. You become a shell of your former self on a deep biological and spiritual level. So I wouldn't do that. There are probably other people in the world that would consider that, but I don't care. Pilgrim disappears to something people don't understand, including in this intelligence services or governments. I don't care, I'll be fine if they put me into prison for 20 years. Which let's be clear, it's not something that I think is realistic, but let's just think about it as a hypothetical situation. I would rather starve myself to death and die there reboot the whole game than do something stupid."

          "value": "2 (81m 38s):\nSo when I got stuck in France, unable to leave the country for a few months, I was offered to meet the head of state foreign intelligence services through a person I know quite well. He's actually a well-known tech entrepreneur in France and he's well connected. And he said, this guy wants to meet you. I said, okay, fine, let's do that. But I'm not promising anything. I took the meeting and in this meeting I was asked to restrict what I see as restriction of freedom of speech in Romania. I don't know if you followed the whole saga with the Romanian elections. They had a presidential elections last year. The results also got canceled. Now Romania, at that point when I had this meeting, was preparing for a new presidential elections. The conservative candidate was not somebody who the French government was supportive of. So they asked me whether I would be shutting down ready to shut down channels on Telegram that support the conservative candidate, the pro-European candidates. So they called the guy they liked. I said, look, if there is no violation of the rules of Telegram, which are quite clear, you can't call to violence. But if, if it's a peaceful demonstration, if it's a peaceful debate, we can't do this. It's would be political Censorship. We protected freedom of speech in many countries in the world, put in Asia and Eastern Europe and middle the Middle East. We're not going to start engaging in Censorship and Europe no matter who is asking us. I was very clear to the guy who was the head of French intelligence, I said, if you think that because I'm stuck here, you can tell me what to do. You are very wrong. I would rather do the opposite every time. And in a way that's what I did. I had a small debate with him about the morality of this whole thing and then at a certain point just disclose the content of this entire conversation because I never signed an nda. I don't ever sign NDAs with any people like that. I wanna be able to tell the world what's going on. And that's quite shocking to me that you would have people in the French government trying to get advantage of this situation. Of course, if you know they had nothing to do with the start of this investigation itself and use it to reach their political or geopolitical goals, I consider it an attempt to humiliate myself personally and millions of Telegram users collectively. And it's quite strange that the same agency asked us to do certain things in Moldova as well. So even before that, I think it was October last year or September, I was arrested in Paris in late August. And then again approached through an intermediary and asked, would you mind taking down some channels in Moldova because there is an election going on and we are afraid there gonna be some interference with this elections. Could you please connect with representatives of the government of Moldova and take care of it? Said, we are happy to take a look at it and see if there is content there that is in violation of our rules. And they sent us a list of channels and bots. Some of them were. So it was a very short list and some of these channels and bots were in violation indeed of our rules. And we took them down, only a few of them. The rest were okay. Then they said thank you and sent us another list of dozens of channels, many, many channels. We looked at these channels, we realized that there is no solid foundation to justify banning them and we refuse to do that. But interestingly enough, the French intelligence services that were asking us to do this in Moldova, let me know through their contact that after Telegram banned the few channels that were in violation of our rules in Moldova, they talked to my judge, the investigative judge in this investigation that is started, has been started against me and told the judge good things about me, which I found very confusing and in a way shocking because these two matters have nothing in common. Why would anyone talk to an investigative judge that is trying to find out whether Telegram did a good enough job in removing illegal content in France? What does Moldova have to do with it? I got very suspicious at that moment. Remember it happened after we, we blocked a few channels that violated our rules, but before we refused to block a long list of other channels that were completely fine, which is people expressing political views, which I may not agree with, but it's their right to express them. Not extreme views, not views. That call to violence, that wasn't extremely alarming. That was a moment when I told myself that there may be more going on here that I initially thought initially I, yeah, some people are confused about how technology works and here after this case in Moldova, I get much more suspicious. So by the time that head of Intelligence services met me to ask about Romania to help them silencing, silencing conservative voices in Romania was already wary of what can be going on next."

Political ideology that you fight for your creating a platform that as long as they don't call for violence, allows people from all walks of life, from all ideologies to speak their mind. That's the whole point. And it happens to be conservative voices in the remaining election that the French government wanted to censor because currently the French government leads left. But if you flip everything around and the government will be right wing, you'd be fighting for against Censorship of left-wing voices. And you have in the past many times."

I think this situation, this historic wrong that's been done is put simply as just a gigantic PR mistake for France. France. There's no entrepreneur that sees that aspires to be the next pa Durov to create the next telegram. Sees this and wants to operate in France after seeing this. There is no justification for this arrest. There's a misapplication of the law, all kinds of pressures, all kinds of behavior that seems politically motivated, all that kind of stuff. All the excessive regulation and the bureaucracy a nightmare for entrepreneurs that dream to create something impactful and positive for the world. So what, what do you think needs to be fixed about the French government, the French system, and then zooming out because you have see similar kinds of things in Europe that could enable entrepreneurs, that could reverse the trend that we seem to be seeing in Europe that beco is becoming less and less friendly to entrepreneurs. What can be fixed, what should be fixed?"

'cause today, if you take France for example, which is a beautiful country with a lot of talented people, but public expenses are 58% of the country's GDP, it's maybe as much more than in the latest stage of the Soviet Union. So you have this, this balance where you have many more people representing the state as opposed to people trying to bring the country's economy forward by creating great products and great companies. The startup field in my field, social media field has been affected by immensely. There was great startup in this realm in France in the last 10 years. It was his location based social network was eventually sold to Snapchat, but before it was not sold, the founder asked me whether he should sell. I told him, never sell. You have a great thing going. You have lots of users, you have organic traction in many countries. And the first of the kind of this kind success story in France. But then he sold anyway in a couple weeks and later I met him, he's trying to do a new thing now. I met him and I asked him, I was trying to understand what went wrong and one of the things he told me about is that while he was trying to run his company, you know, competing with Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, having all this pressure from investors trying to hire the best people and persuade them to Go to Paris. And he did a great job by the way. But while he was trying to do that, he got also attacked by some silly investigation, again involving the data protection issues, which lasted forever and was gradually sucking blood of his team and his company, constant interrogations, disclosure requests. And you know, this is a young company, it significantly increases the level of stress and at some point I think the pressure was too much. He decided to again, just sell it. Eventually it turned out that there was no issue. The investigation ended as far as I understand with no charges but such investigations. They have a price, they have a cost. And unless the society realizes the cost of projects of companies, of startups that are never created or sold to the United States at the very early stage or other countries resulting in decreased economic growth, things won't change. I, I think we just talked to a guy a few days ago who left France and started a business here in Dubai and one of the reasons he had to leave France is that the government started an investigation on his company and they froze his bank accounts. And this investigation that involved taxes lasted for many, many years. I believe he said eight years. And at the end of this eight years, the government reached to the conclusion that there was nothing wrong. His good, it's okay. In the meantime, his corporate bank accounts were frozen, his business died. The only reason why he was able to retain sanity is because he moved to Dubai and started a new company which is incredibly successful. And now he's enriching this city, which we're in right now with his great ideas and creativity."

Yeah, but I guess the French public or some part of the French public was misled and I don't know when may, perhaps since the time of the French Revolution to believe that entrepreneurs are somehow their enemies, they're the evil rich people that are the cause of all problems. If, if only you could make the rich share their ill-gotten wealth with the rest of the population, then every problem will be magically solved. In reality though, a lot of these people that are starting such companies with fire in their eyes are sacrificing their lives. The livelihood, they're, they're working 20 hours a day, they're experiencing immense stress in order to fulfill their vision and bring value and good to the society around them. They create jobs, they create great services, they create great goods, they make your country grow, they make your people proud, they have to cherish them, but what does the system do to them? It squeezes them out because you know, perhaps there was somebody in the tax authority that decided to advance their career and perhaps you know, was too ambitious and not too smart. So as a result, a company was destroyed and now the same entrepreneur, by the way who we talked to is invited to co come back to France. He's being offered really good terms. He said, you're gonna open this new venue on there, we're gonna give you the best location we're gonna fund part of it, tax breaks. And he said, never just forget about this. It's impossible. I'm not coming back to France. He's traumatized by the experience and he's French, he was born there, he's a French passport. So unless things like this change, France will and the rest of Europe will keep struggling with economic growth, with budget deficits, with unemployment and all the other relevant social and economic metrics."

The idea behind the school was that if you try to squeeze as much information as possible into a brain of a teenager making a focus on math and foreign languages, Then there will be some changes in the brain of the student that will allow the student to understand most other disciplines. But we had a class as a result that didn't have any single focus. It was very widespread across a lot of disciplines. You would have four foreign languages at least including Latin, English, French, German. In addition, you can get ancient Greek, you would have classes like biochemistry or psychoanalysis, evolutionary psychology. The difference of this class as opposed to other classes in the same school, which was part of the St. Petersburg State University and called academic gymnasium, was that unlike other classes which were specialized in some single subject like physics or math or history, this one tried to get the best from all of these specialized classes and bring into one curriculum. Since it was an experimental class, it wasn't possible to become a straight A student to be excellent in all the subject. It's always like considered crazy to even try."

Because normally if you keep challenging authorities you just get kicked out of all schools and then you end up nowhere. So I eventually got into a school where challenging teachers was not fully okay, but it was something that you could do and then you would start a debate with the teacher and normally they would allow you to express your point of view and then some objective truth may come out of it as a result. But at that point I was pretty bored with my life. You know, every teenager gets to a point when they have this sort of existential crisis, what's the point of life? What am I even doing here? At some point I decided since I have to Go to school anyway, I might as well try to do something impossible and become the best students and get a an A or would we called five in the Russian system on every single subject and that kept me busy for a while. It was incredibly difficult because you didn't have enough time, even if you just studied all the time not doing anything else, you didn't have any time left to prepare all the homework tasks and get ready for all the tests. So I ended up using the breaks between classes, but I get to the result I wanted to get though I got the excellent mark in every subject and that kept, kept me happy for a while. What"

It's something that shapes your brain, it teaches you to rely on your logical thinking to split big problems into smaller parts, put them in the right sequence, solve them patiently try and again, if it doesn't work, this is exactly the same skill you need in programming and project management and start it when you start your own company and it's one of the few subjects in school which encourages you to develop your own thinking as opposed to rely on what other people have to say and just repeating their opinions. That is extremely valuable. And of course once you're good at math, you can apply it in physics and engineering in coding. And it's not surprising that most of the most successful tech founders and CEOs are very good at Madison coding because ultimately it's the same mental skill that you rely on. But back then in the school I realized something else as well. It's that competition is really important. Competition is key. This is what motivates a lot of teenagers when they're at school and if you remove competition out of the education system, you end up forcing kids to start competing elsewhere. For example, in video games, it's a trend you see now in many countries, including in the west, when well-meaning authorities or parents say we don't want our kids to be too stressed, we don't want them to feel anxiety, so let's just get rid of all the public grading system, all this rankings of who won, who lost. We don't want any of that. And part of it is justified, but as a result, some kids lose interest. Yes, you eliminate the lunar losers, but you end up eliminating the winners as well. And then if you are overprotective of the kids in that age, they grow up graduate schools, the universities and they're still not prepared for real life because real life is constant competition for jobs, for promotions, for customers, and it's more brutal. What you have as a result is high suicide rates, high unemployment, all the things and negative trends you see now in many countries which thought eliminating competition from their education system was a good idea. They still persist, they still think competition's a bad thing. They try to eliminate competition from their economy as well to an extent saying we are gonna make sure the losers don't lose and the winners don't get too much, but as a result they make their entire systems less competitive. The entire economies, some of them in Europe are now struggling to keep up with China, with South Korea, with Singapore, with Japan and other places where the education system was based on ruthless competition. So this is a hard choice any civilization has to make. We support competition understanding that eventually leads to progress in science and technology and abundance for society at large. Or we remove competition thinking that somehow we can shield the future generations from the stress that competition inevitably causes. Yeah, I mean it's"

Either you do it early or you do it later and it's true. That's such a good point that competition does seem to be a really powerful driver of skill, skill development, like you mentioned, pursue mastery. There's something in Human Nature that especially for for young people, if you can compete at a thing, you're gonna be really driven to get good at that thing. If you can direct that in the education system as China does, as many as many nations like you mentioned do, then you're going to develop a lot of brilliant people, resilient people, people that are ready to create epic shit in the world."

I would ask him about dinosaurs and galaxies and black holes and neanderthals, everything I could think of and he was my Wikipedia back in the time when we didn't have internet access. He's a unique prodigy kid, probably one of a billion. He started reading at the age of three I think, and he pretty fast got so advanced in maths, but by the age of six you could already read really sophisticated books on astronomy. Sometimes when he did it in public places like buses or metro, my mom was criticized by people who were witnessing it. They would tell her, why are you mocking your own kid with this serious book? It's obvious that the kid can't understand everything there. It's too complicated even we don't understand anything there. There's some formulas and he was already sucking in this knowledge. He's just has this thirst for information. So he was the source of all kind of great facts, useful things, inspiring things. He taught me pretty much everything I know at the same time he's incredibly modest and kind and this is something I think a lot of people that think they're smart but not generally intelligent, lack more often than not people who are truly intelligent. They're also kind and compassionate"

Can you talk to me about your programming journey that led to the creation of vk? What was the VK stack? Is it PHP mostly? How did you figure out how to program websites, all of that?"

          "value": "2 (119m 11s):\nIt's actually an interesting thing that we sometimes don't realize it, but scarcity leads to creativity and one of the reasons you have so many people who love to code coming from the Soviet Union or other places which didn't have much access to modern technology and more importantly modern entertainment, is that perhaps we were not so much distracted by all this abundance of different entertainment options, which is not to say it's bad to have those options, it's just a fact that we sometimes don't appreciate. So I started to build computer games. My brother would sometimes guide me, for example, I would create a term based strategy. Of course two dimensional back then three dimensional was too much for me, but it wasn't as sleek in terms of the scrolling FPS frames per second parameter and asked my brother how to optimize it. He would guide me and this kind of learning and training really shaped my coding skills when I was younger. And then I started to create video games for my classmates when we played, for example, to toe in an infinite field in my class during the breaks, you know, and not to toe the three in a row, this is was a bit five in a row and an and an infinite field. This is a much more interesting game and it gets quite complicated if you keep playing it. My classmates used to love it and some of my classmates were really smart, you know, champions of Math Olympics, son and daughters of professors at the university and I decided, no, I wanna win every single time. Yeah, I don't wanna lose even a single time. So how do I win or I need to practice more, but how do I practice more? I need an Napoleon stronger than myself. So I coded this game so that I would play against the computer and the computer would calculate I think four moves in advance to choose the optimal strategy. That wasn't enough. Four moves in advance, I would still win over it if I tried to calculate five or six, it was too slow. So I asked my brother to help me out here so he make this algorithm. Eventually I trained myself to win every single time, even with the computer. Back then we didn't have modern CPUs and I could still retain some self-confidence. We go back to school during breaks, play with my classmates and soon people started to lose interest. None of my classmates wanted to play this game anymore. I killed the game. There isn't, yeah. So after that, when I got into the scene, Peterburg State University, it was quite boring just to study because this was too easy. So I thought, what can I do there? I created a website for the students of my faculty. First I organized the creation of digital answers to all exams and digitalized version of all lectures, which was something very unique back then. Remember it was 25 years ago, I would put together a website where I would publish all these materials and pretty soon it became super popular. I opened a discussion forum there in a few years. I expanded to the university with all of its other departments and then to other universities. We ended up having tens of thousands of users just as a students portal. We had all kinds of social features there, friends lists, photo albums, profiles, blogs, all of it was quite successful. And after I graduated the university, one of my ex classmates from the school reached out to me after reading about my successes in a newspaper, the main business newspaper of St. Facebook, and he asked me, are you trying to build a Russian Facebook? I said, I'm not sure what's Facebook. So we met, he's since he graduated an American university two years before that, he showed me Facebook. I thought, well I can already have all of this technology, but it's valuable to know which elements I should get rid of in order to scale this thing and have millions of users. This is also something people don't appreciate that sometimes in order to move forward and have more success, you have to get rid of things including technology. Getting rid of features is super important."

The existing users will be happy, they'll be praising you, they'll be asking you to add more stuff to make it even more complicated. So it's easy to lose track and get disoriented if you are only relying on the feedback of existing users. So as a result, I started the website called V contact or vk. It means in touch in Russian initially to solve my own personal problem. I graduated the university that same year and I wanted to be in touch, remain in touch with my ex classmates from from the university and and the other fellow students. And of course as a 20-year-old I wanted to meet other people including good looking girls. So I started to build it from scratch. For that one I thought, I'm not going to use any third party libraries modules because I want to make it as efficient as possible. I was obsessing over every line of code, but then how do you start something that large, like I didn't have any prior experience of quitting a project of that scale, which would involve everything before I would reuse some existing solutions here I wanted to build from scratch. So I, I called my brother, he was a postdoc student in Germany at the time in the Max Blank University and I asked him, what should I start from? And he told me, just build a module to authorize users. Just don't, not not just to log in, you know? Yeah. Not even to sign out, just to log in because you can pre-populate the database with with credentials and emails and passwords doesn't really matter. But once you see that you can type in your password an email and you are in and it tells you hello using your name, then you will have a clear understanding where to go from there. Yeah, I mean that's true. That's one of the best advice I've ever got in my life is it worked perfectly by the way. I started to build it and before I knew it I would have there on that website, photo albums, private messages, this guest book we used to call the wall back on vk and I guess in the early days of Facebook we'd end up building something even more sophisticated than Facebook at the time with more features. I had a girlfriend at the time, I asked her we need to somehow come up with a database of all Russian schools and universities and the departments and subdivisions. She did a great job trying to source all this information online or sometimes writing emails to universities saying which departments you have exactly at this point we we need to know or reaching out to the Department of education, but in Russia and then in Ukraine and and then eventually in Belarus and in Kazakhstan and other countries where VK ended up to be the largest and most popular social network. So we did a few things that were quite unique at the time and for the first almost a year, I was the single employee of the company. I was the backend engineer, the front end engineer, the designer. I was the customer support officer, I was the marketing guy as well. L coming up with all the wordings and the announcements, coming up with competitions to promote vk, which worked quite well. That was an incredible experience that gave me knowledge of every aspect of a social networking platform. Also understanding of how much a single person can do. Exactly. It is one of the reasons why I'd like to think I'm an efficient project manager and product manager inside Telegram because I will not take anything but ambitious deadlines from my team members. If somebody gives me, oh, I need three weeks to do that, I would reply, well I built the first version of VK in just two weeks, why would you need three weeks? It seems like something you could make real in these three days, three weeks, what they going to do the rest of the three weeks apart from this three days? And you know, the team knows me and that's why we are able today Telegram, to move at very good pace of innovation every month we're pushing several meaningful features, I think out competing everybody else in this industry in terms of what you can do within the short timeframe. So yes, that experience was invaluable. As for the stack, I started from PHP and my SQL, Debbie and Linux, but very soon I realized I need to optimize this. I started using memc, Apache servers were not enough anymore. We had to set up Engine X and my brother was still living in Germany so he couldn't help me much for the first year of building decay. Sometimes I would manage to get through to him through a call. I would use an old school phone to call him with wires. I said, what do I do? How do I install this thing called Nix? I'm not a Linux guy. If he felt particularly kind that day and not too busy, he would show me the way to do it or set it up himself. But for the most part I had to rely on just myself. Having him there though helped when we started to grow fast and started to scale it. Because at first you realize, right, not one server is not enough. I need to buy another one. Then another one and another one. The database should be in in a, in a different server. Then you have to split the database into tables. Then you have to come up with a, a way to chart the tables using some criteria that would make sense that wouldn't break your user experience. When we got to over a million users and beyond a dozen of servers surviving without the input from my brother in terms of taking care of the scaling aspect of it became impossible. I remember asking him to come back, I guess you need to help me with this thing is starting to be really big. What was worse is that since we became popular, somebody started to do DDoS attacks on us as it always happens, right? And then we had people that wanted to buy a share of EK and interestingly, every time we had a negotiation day they did us attacks intensified. So we had to come up with a way to fight it. I remember having many sleepless night nights trying to figure it out."

I could understand how I implement scalability into the code base, how I short my tables in the database where I include MCAST instead of direct requests to the database. There was quite easy because it was still PHP back in the day when my brother got back from Germany somewhere around 2008, I asked him, can we make it even more efficient? Can we make it super fast and at the same time so that we would require even fewer servers to maintain the load? And he said, yes, but you know PHP is not enough. I'll have to rewrite big part of your data engines in c and c plus plus. I said, okay, let's do that. He invited a friend of his to help him, another absolute champion in world's programming contest twice in a row and they, they put together the first customized data engine, which is far more efficient than just relying on MySQL and MCAST because it was first of all more specialized, more low level."

We think that people can notice the difference even if it's just like 50 million millisecond difference. The difference is subconscious. It also allows us not just to be faster and more responsive but also more efficient when it comes to the infrastructure, the expenses. Because if your code executes faster, it means you need fewer computational resources to run it. So there is no way you can lose in making things faster. And that's why we have always been very careful when hiring people. I would only hire a person if I'm ultimately certain is the best option. If you hire somebody who is maybe a little bit distracted and experienced, you may end up with inefficiencies in your code base that results in tens of millions of dollars of losses. And think about the responsibility, like if we jump to today from the VK days, gram is used by over a billion people. They open it dozens of times every day. Imagine the app opens with a slight delay, say half a second delay multiplied by dozens of times by a billion. It gets centuries, millennia lost for humanity without any reason other than just being sloppy."

Like the code doesn't scream at you saying this could be much faster. So you have to actually, as a craftsman, be very careful when you're writing a code and always thinking, can this be done much more efficiently? And it can be tiny things because they all propagate throughout the code. And so there's a real cost in having a careless developer anywhere in the company because they can introduce that inefficiency and all the other developers won't know. They'll just assume it kind of has to be that way. And so there's a real responsibility for every single individual developer that's building any component of an app like Telegram to just always ask, okay, can this be done more efficiently? Can this be done more simply? And that's like one of the most beautiful aspects, the art forms of programming, right?"

They're not keeping up with the pace of of of, of the really feature release schedule and you think I probably have to hire a third one. But then you notice that one of them is really weird, falling behind the schedule, complaining some of the time doesn't assume responsibility. And you ask, so what if I just fired this person and you fire this person in a few weeks, you realize you actually don't need and you never needed the third engineer. The problem was this guy who created more issues and more problems than he solved. That is so counterintuitive because you know, in developing tech projects we tend to think that you just throw more people into something and then things get solved miraculously by themselves just because more people means more attention from them.

Most often it's about natural ability and persistence in 90% of percent of cases, it's just the inability to focus on one task for an extended period of time. Not everybody has this ability.

If you want to create an ideal process for selecting the most qualified people for certain specific tasks you have in mind what can be better than a competition, A coding contest where everybody who wants to join your company as an engineer or just wants to get some prize money or validation can demonstrate their skills and then we just select the best. Or if we are not certain because there's not enough data to hire somebody, we just repeat the contest with another task, get more data, get more winners, then repeat again. And as at some, at some point you realize, oh actually this guy has competed in 10 of our contests since he was 16 years old or 14-year-old. Now he's 20 or 21. He won in eight of these competitions. He seems to be really good in JavaScript on Android, Java and also c plus plus. Why not hire this person? There is some consistency there and a lot of these people, they have never worked in a big company before, which is priceless because in a big company people tend to shift responsibility. They have this shared responsibility wherein nobody fully understands who can take credit for a project, who can take blame for a project Inside Telegram. It's pretty clear. And these competitions are the closest experience to what people will have when working at Telegram. So for example, we wanna implement certain very tricky animation and redesign tour, the profile page of the Telegram as Android version. And the Android app, it's an Open source app. Anybody can take its code and play with it with. So as a result, we would not just select the best person and hire this person, we would also select the best solution to the problem because we would not suggest the contestants to solve trivial problems. It's something that's valuable. It saves a lot of time for us in terms of development. And because I always had this large social media platforms which I could use to promote these competitions, right? Somehow both VK and Telegram were very popular among engineers and designers, other tech people. I had no issue to find to promote this concept and find the right people ever. And what can be better than for an employee of your company, of somebody who has been a user of it. If this person has no prior experience of using xlo, their understanding would be very limited. Why would I even try to hire somebody from LinkedIn who worked at Google and other companies is used to receiving salary for nothing, is used to shift responsibility and being stuck in endless meetings and have very limited understanding of what Telegram stands for. It's just crazy if you think about it."

And then as a result, I got a chance to sit in, in one of the team meetings where people discuss the different features that are being developed, the different ideas, some of which are at the very cutting edge. And so you get to see behind the scenes how it's possible to have such a fast rate of idea generation. So you generate the idea, you implement the prototype, and then you eventually it becomes an actual feature in the product. And so that's why you have this kind of half hilarious half incredible fact that for many, as compared to WhatsApp and Signal, you've led the way on many other features. Many of the features we take for granted now, many of which we know and love, like the auto delete timer that was seven years ahead of any other Messenger message editing replies, these are all like obvious things you, I've even forgotten for some of them that they even were never part. I mean I think auto delete timer is a really brilliant idea."

It's funny thing about it is then when other apps started to copy it, like WhatsApp seven years after and then signal in some other of these apps, they initially even copied the exact timestamps. So for example, if we had like one, three and five seconds, they would also have one, three and five seconds. Yeah. They tried not to change it because they were not sure what was the magic sauce behind the feature. And it ironically, it happens with many of these things. For example, when we design how you reply to a message and you have a small snippet showing that you're replying to this message and now you're typing your response, then there is a small snippet into the message itself that if you tap on it highlights the original message you are replying to. Seems pretty obvious, but there are certain design decisions that we were implementing at the time and we got this vertical line on the left and all these other small things that are completely arbitrary, right? You can do it in a different way, but somehow the entire industry ended up copying exactly that solution. So now whenever you Go to WhatsApp, Instagram direct, Facebook Messenger is signal, it doesn't matter. You would see exactly the same or pretty much similar experience because nobody really wants to take the risk and innovate. If something works, why not just copy it?"

And thing under it is your reply. The distinction between the different formatting, the text, I mean, there's a, listen, I know how much typography is in art form. There's a lot of interacting, graphic artistic elements in Cy Telegram that all have to play together extremely well. Like you pointed out to me, this thing that just blew my mind, which is the background gradient of telegram shifts, it changes and it adjusts really nicely to the bubbles, the chat bubbles, and then there's like graphic elements on top of the gradient that all interplay together. So all of that has to work really nicely without sacrificing clarity. Everything's just intuitive. That's very difficult to create. That is art. And on top of that super fast,"

There's a, there is a, there's a feeling, there's a pleasant feeling when you're reading a chat and that's where the de the design contributes to that. I think a gradient really does. I really love that about telegram. The gradient, not the technical thing you described, but the feeling of it. And then the technical aspect of creating that feeling is incredible. I could probably come up with all kinds of algorithms of rendering that gradient that's going to be super inefficient. And so doing that efficiently is like,"

That person can instantly say, oh no, it's not the right thing. So you can have to introduce certain randomness there. And then you have the gradient, but it's not enough. It's to plant, you want to have certain pattern as an overlay, but it should be simple enough not to distract you from the content, but it has to be entertaining enough to create a good feeling about the whole app. And another question, what kind of objects you want to include in this pattern and how this pattern would work? Will it be based on pixels or would it be vector based? And would it be vector based? So they will be influenced with scalable and high quality. And then I think for the default pattern and the default background, which is based on four colors, it's not a gradient based on two colors, it's four colors and they're constantly shifting. I probably look through several thousand variations of that because this is such an important decision to make. It's the default beg, of course you can change it actually. You can set up your own four colors for that. You can change it no way. Really. Yes, you can do it. And you want to rely on certain deeply hardcoded biological properties of the human mind, right? So which color do you want to use? Is it gonna be blue, is it gonna be yellow? Is it going to be green? Because each color has different meaning in our brain and what kind of objects we want to put there. Something from our childhood, something from nature or something that can create a different kind of mode. And this is just one detail of the app. So there are many details. When you send a message, you are done typing a message and you just then tap send, and then the message gradually appears in the chat. How does it happen? So you want the input field to slowly morph into the actual message. To the message. Yeah. And, and you want this to be done regardless of the context of the message. Because sometimes the with would be different. Sometimes it'll be containing media or a link preview or other stuff that will change the message bubble. So you go through countless different scenarios and make sure every one of them works great, even if this message contains 4,000 characters. And then you look at all the platforms, iOS, Android, and all the old devices, all kinds of outdated operating systems and the hardware. And you cross the tool because you can have this really bad old phone, but using the newest operating system version. So what do you do? What kind of bugs you get there? And then of course, since Telegram works on tablets as well, and our iOS version works on an iPad, which I love a lot, you have to understand that everything can be really big. So it can consume a space on your screen and then it'll trigger using more computational resources to render it. So there are a lot of nuances to it, but as long as you obsess over every small detail, at least every detail that really counts, you can get to a user experience. If you're really used to Telegram, if you've been a regular user for at least a few weeks, going back to any other messaging app feels like a serious downgrade."

It feels too long to imposing. So what you want to do is you want the message disappear while the message messages around it go closer to each other to fill the resulting gap. And then you imagine what it involves redrawing the entire screen. So on top of this very complicated animation, you have to think about things like which kind of messages were there before, after that just adds to complexity."

Is this an experience that maybe even subconsciously inspires them and makes their heart sing even a little bit, fills them with joy, lightens up their mood even a little bit by 0.001%? Or is it something that is just basic? And I think if we can bring some value in people's lives, even through this subtle details, we have to definitely invest our time in it"

And you're absolutely right. I mean I, it's not about deleting messages. Like I feel a little inkling of joy when I see that evaporation animation. It's just nice.

          "value": "2 (163m 12s):\nAhead of WhatsApp. Yes. But the stickers that WhatsApp ended up launching three years and eight months after on were not, the first version were not, was not really good because they just did regular gifts or Web M videos, which were not based on vector graphics. What we did is vector animations. Each of these stickers is only several kilobytes, sometimes maybe maximum 20, 30 kilobytes in size, but it says 180 frames. We were able to run them at 60 frames per second on all devices. And it's also very challenging. It was a challenging thing to do. We had so much headache trying to make it work. Nobody even tried to do anything like this before us because it's crazily difficult. But as a result, you have these fluid animations, you have this really nice user experience. Somebody sends you a sticker, you don't have to wait for it to load because it's so lightweight and it starts moving instantly. And then of course, it's not just engineering. You have to find designers that are able to create the stickers using vector graphics, which means they're based on curves described by formulas, not just created as photographs with pixels. Where do you find these people? Again, we did competitions but was not easy to assemble a team of artists slash artists, artists slash engineers I would say, that are able to do something like this. This is a unique form of art and this allowed us to do a revolution in stickers. Then another revolution in animated emoji that you can add into messages, custom animated emoji. I don't think anybody did that. I think tog is still the only one allowing users to do that because you can include a hundred of animated emoji in a message and they will be animated and it'll be moving and your device won't crash. It's probably unnecessary and crazy, but we think somewhere in this intersection of art and engineering, true quality is created. And then of course, more recently we expanded into what we call telegram gifts, which are essentially blockchain based collectibles that you can demonstrate on your telegram profile so that they get social relevance, but you can also use them to congratulate your friends and close the one with their birthdays and other holidays. And that was received extremely well."

But to me still the the, the Vector graphics, and it's not just simple graphics, it's incredibly intricate graphics. So the vector makes it very efficient, but it also allows you to create, maybe incentivizes the artist, enables them, incentivizes them to create super detailed intricate elements. And then the final result, like you would think it wouldn't matter, but the final result has like a lot of stuff going on and it's, and it allows you to the scale on arbitrary devices and not now it's like this little, you know, like usually gif from like back in the day and still in meme form or low resolution. And so that descent, usually people don't have to put details and intricate art into it. But here with Vector Graphics, it's like, like a million things going on and it allows you to play with different animations. Like you showed me this thing where you send and you hold for a while on the send button and so you can share with the person you send a message to this animation that you've encoded, like there's a bunch of stuff going on when they read the message."

And we thought, yes, we're designing this product in a way that is already extremely secure, but we want to make sure that not even we can access user messages. And we understood very clearly that a bunch of people who were born in Russia don't necessarily inspire trust. So that's why we made Telegram Open source. So all our apps have been open available on GitHub since 2013. And then we added into an Encryption in our secret chat, which WhatsApp copied a few years after one year and three months ahead they just started to test it. They rolled this out I think 2016, which is three years after us. And the only reason I think the rest of the industry had to do it is because we set the standard. It was incredibly important back in the day. And the same time we realized certain limitations of entered Encryption. So within that design, that architecture, you can't support very large chat communities with consistent persistent chat histories. You can't support huge one to many channels. You'd have issues with maintaining bots that have lots of incoming messages, Multiple device support becomes tricky. People will end up losing some of the documents they share. So we also see, saw a lot of issues and we ended, ended up having this sort of hybrid experience where depending on your use case and your requirements, you can choose the level of Encryption that you want to have."

For example, you can't screenshot them, you can't forward any document, any message from them, which is not necessarily something you need when you are trying to get some work done and you are just communicating with your team on a project. So it became very clear to us that there are different needs here and if you try to combine both in one type of chat, you will end up losing a lot of utility. You know, we, at Telegram, we don't use any collaboration tool for teamwork. We use Telegram to build Telegram. So we felt instantly when we were trying to switch to say Secret Chats to share large documents and try to get work done, it was just not adapted for it. At the same time, if you were really paranoid, you think, you know, I don't wanna be screenshotted I I don't want to have any leaks. I don't even trust Telegram, I only trust Code Secret Chess are the best option, I believe is the most secure means of communication today."

For that you need to make your apps Open source for any researchers to have a look at it. So Telegram has been Open source since 2013. Apps like WhatsApp have never been Open source, so you don't really know what they're doing and how exactly they encrypt your messages. What's important here though is to understand whether the version of the app that you download from the app store corresponds exactly to the source code that you can view on GitHub and for that you need reproducible builds. As you said, telegram is the only popular messaging app that does that. We allow people to make sure both on Android and IRS that the source code of Telegram on GitHub and the app you are actually using is the same app. I think it's incredibly important not just to gain people's trust, but just to stay transparent and open about it. When I make this claim that telegrams secret chats are the most secure way of communicating, I really mean it because I haven't seen any fact contradicting this claim, at least among the popular messaging app you say WhatsApp, signal, iMessage, none of them have reproducible bills on both. None of them had at least at the same level put so much effort into making sure that the algorithms that you use in order to encrypt data are not algorithms that have been handed to you by some agency in order to create a honeypot, at least from what I know about our competitors, I don't think they went through the same process."

What it seems you would discover, and this is something that I found quite shocking at the time, that a lot of people who you thought were security and cryptography experts ended up being agents of the NSA in one way or the other, promoting flawed Encryption standards. You wouldn't end up discovering that your government that was supposed to be limited in how it can surveil its people actually doesn't consider itself that limited. And that was very valuable for the world to understand. I guess it also can be a lesson demonstrated that we humans don't get their balance right. So nine 11 created a situation when the government had to respond and it responded, but it overreacted, it ended up in ODing certain basic rights and freedoms including the right to privacy because the government always wants to increase its powers and the government always tries to do it at the expense of citizens. You have the situation when the cure is worse than the disease. I think it was incredibly brave to do what Edward did. I didn't get to work with him. Whoever see him in person, we keep in touch, we sometimes communicate, but we are not close. I still, I think what he did is laudable. I hope someday we meet"

          "value": "2 (181m 59s):\nSo in 2018, telegram started to become popular. I think we had something like 200 million users and it increasingly became popular in places like Iran and Russia and other countries where sometimes people have something to hide from the government. In Iran, people used to protest against the government. They had these huge channels that would, they would use to organize the protests and eventually the government couldn't keep up. They decided to ban Telegram. People would still keep using it though using VPNs, it didn't help. The government invested a lot in coming up with their own messaging app. They had several teams competing for the title of the nationally IRE messaging app. All these apps failed. People still prefer Telegram. Interesting. Iran banned Telegram, but WhatsApp wasn't banned or at least they un banned WhatsApp. Soon after, at the same time starting in mid 2017 or late 2017, Russia demanded that Telegram hands them the Encryption keys. They thought these things exist, something that would allow them to read messages of every person on Telegram or at least every person on Telegram in Russia. And we told them, if you have to ban us, ban us. And this is what they ended up doing in spring 2018. And that was quite fun because they were trying to block our IP addresses, but we were prepared for that. And we came up with this technology that allowed us to rotate IP addresses, replacing them with new ones every time the sensor blocks our existing addresses and then it was completely automated. We had millions of IP addresses would be burning through them. We set up this movement called digital resistance when system administrators and engineers all around the world, both inside and outside Russia could set up their own proxy servers and their own IP addresses for Telegram to rely on in order to bypass Censorship. We ended up spending I think, millions of dollars on that and as a result, the sensor got crazy there. There would ban IP addresses and largest subnets of IP N address then huge subnets, which resulted in a weird situation where parts of the country's infrastructure started to go down, like people were trying to pay for groceries and the supermarkets and nothing would work because the Russian sensor blocked too many IP addresses and some of the subnets were used to host other unrelated services. Even some Russian social networks and media got affected banks. So they had to start being more selective in how they combat our anti-censorship tools. The biggest resistance we got at the time was from Apple. Apple didn't allow us to update Telegram in the app store saying for at least four weeks that we have to come to an agreement with Russia first who said it's not possible. They said, we will allow you to push your update for Telegram worldwide except for Russia. We didn't want to do that. Almost lost hope. You know, at some point I said, you know, maybe this is the only way, maybe we should leave the Russian market, stop allowing users from Russia to download the app from the app store, which should mean it's over. We helped organize certain protests in Defense of Telegram and privacy and freedom of speech in 2018 in Moscow. There was hilarious people flying paper airplanes."

I have to say that Apple sided with the sensor that we're trying to do the right thing here, but without Apple we can't do much because people can't download your app anymore. I published it in my channel and then New York Times picked it up with the picture of the protestors flying paper airplanes. Apple was criticized in the story and I thought, well Apple should probably come back to the right side of history here. And I waited for one day and two days. In the meantime, since we've been unable to update Telegram for more than a month, It started to fall apart because the new version of iOS came out and it made the old versions of Telegram obsolete. Some features that used to work stopped working and users all over the world started to suffer. Like people that had nothing to do with Russia from other parts of the world experienced it, experienced issues with with Telegram. So it was really serious and I said to my team, you know what if by 6:00 PM today, I think it was a Friday, nothing changes and Apple doesn't allow us to push the version of TG through, let's just forget about the Russian market, let's keep going because the rest of the world is more important. It's sad, but what can we do?"

Your update is approved. And we managed to keep playing this hide and sea game with the sensor bypassing Censorship through digital resistance. In Iran, it was a little bit different because we realized it would've been too expensive to try to come up with all these IP addresses. And in addition, it was not clear whether we wouldn't be in violation of the sanctions regime. So we did something else. We created an economic incentive for people who would set up proxy servers for Telegram. Any person, say an Iranian engineer could come up with a proxy server, distribute its address among users in Iran, and whoever connected through the proxy of this person would be able to see a pinned chat, an ad placed there by the system administrator, the owner of the proxy, and this is how you can monetize your proxy. So it created this market which resulted in Iranians fixing their own problem, and as a result we kept millions or maybe tens of millions of Iranian users up until this day. I think Telegram is still banding Iran today, but we probably have something like 50 million people relying on telegram from that country. So"

In the meantime, we had a couple of countries trying to ban telegram. So it was exactly the best moment for me to start sharing anything related to my personal health. But that was something that is hard to forget that you know, I never fall ill. I have, I believe I have perfect health. I very rarely have headaches or bad cough. I don't take pills because I don't have to take pills. And that was the only instant in my life when I think I was dying. I came back home, opened the door of my townhouse, the place I rented, I had this weird neighbor, he left something for me there around the door and one hour after when I was already in my bed. So I was living alone. I felt very bad. I felt pain all over my body. I tried to get up and Go to the bathroom, but while I was going there, I felt that functions of my body started to switch off first the eyesight and hearing then I had difficulty breathing everything accompanied by very acute pain, heart, stomach, all blood vessels. It was, it's a difficult thing to explain, but one thing I was certain about is, yeah, this is it. You thought you were gonna die. Yeah, this is it. Because I couldn't breathe, I couldn't see anything was very painful. I think it's over. I thought, well, I have had, I had a good life. I managed to accomplish a few, accomplish a few things, and then I collapsed on the floor, but I don't remember it because the pain covered everything. I found myself on the floor the next day was already bright and I couldn't stand up. I was super weak. I looked at my arms with my body, blood vessels were broken all over my body. Something like this never happened to me. I couldn't walk for two weeks after I stayed at my place. And I decided not to tell most of my team about it because again, I don't want it. I didn't want them to worry. But it was tough. That was tough."

They didn't trust in the integrity of the election results to the state Duma in Russia. I remember 2011, I still lived in Russia running vk. There was no telegram. So the government demanded that we take down the opposition groups of Navalny from VK that had hundreds of thousands of members and that were used to organize this protest. And I very publicly refused to do that. I just decided it's not the right thing to do. People have the right to assemble. And I mocked the pro who handed me that demand. I put out a scan of it and next to it a photo of a dog in a hoodie with a it tongue out. And I said, this is my official response to the pres request to ban position groups. That was very funny at the moment. But then I had armed policemen trying to get into my apartment and I thought about many things at that moment. I asked myself, did I make the right choice? And I came to the conclusion that I made the right choice and I asked myself what would be the next thing"

They're ready to die for other people or certain principles that he strongly believe in. I'm not alone here. I guess Edward Snowden was ready to die as well, or some other people like Assan. Also, at that moment I realized there's no way to communicate securely. I need to tell my brother what's going on there, probably going after him. How do I tell him without betraying him? Because in 2011, remember WhatsApp was already there. I think they launched in 2009, but it had zero Encryption. All messages were plain text and transit, meaning that even your system administrator, let alone your carrier had access to your messages. It was only after Telegram started this push for Encryption that this other apps suddenly remember that privacy wasn't their DNA as WhatsApp founders famously stated, but it must have been a dormant gene in 2011."

I was summoned to the pres, answered some silly questions, fewer questions that I had to answer more recently in the French investigation case case. But it was the beginning of the end. It was clear that there's no way I'm going to be allowed to run VK the way I wanted it to run. There was the moment I packed my backpack and just started to wait, just I moved to hotel and realized any day I can leave the country, I kept running vk.

And it would be incredibly sad if Russia restores its attempts to ban Telegram because currently it's been used by its population for all kinds of purposes. Not just personal communication or economic business activities, but also it is the only platform which allows the Russian people to access independent sources of information. If you think about media outlets such as BBC or any other non Russians source of source of information, they're only accessible in Russia through Telegram in the form of telegram channels. Their websites a banned some other social media sites a banned. And as you said, like there are indications that Russia is planning to migrate users from existing messaging apps such as WhatsApp and Telegram to their own homegrown tool, which would of course be fully transparent to the government and wouldn't allow voices independent from the government to express themselves. It's certainly an alarming trend. We see these attempts in countries that are not famous for protecting freedom of speech, but also increasingly in countries that have been known to protect freedoms. And this creates this vicious circle because in a way, European countries trying to fight freedom of speech under pretext that sound legitimate, such as combating misinformation or election interference, they create precedence and they legitimize restrictions to freedom of speech, which then in turn be used by authoritarian regimes. And they would say in places like China or Iran that they're not doing anything different. It's the norm now to strict voices that go, don't go in line with the mainstream narrative. That's sad because one of the things that makes our life interesting is this abundance of different viewpoints of different people that we get to experience. You limit the freedom of people, you inevitably decelerate economic growth, level of happiness, the way people can contribute to the society, the way people can express themselves. I personally think it would be a huge mistake to ban a tool like Telegram in any country, particularly a large country such as Russia, because the Russian people are incredibly talented and resilient people. They are among the first to start utilizing some of this recent innovations that Telegram implements. They're the early adopters. I say them and also the Americans, perhaps other people from Eastern Europe like Ukrainians and Southeast Asians. They're among the first people to start using any new edition that we launch. They're incredibly hungry for innovation."

You take Stalinist Russia or Nazi Germany or Maui, China did always use the same trick that say, we need to limit your freedom of speech because these people who are masquerading as a position are actually the agents of this other country that wants to take over. That's why dear citizens forget about their freedoms. And now increasingly you see similar attempts in free countries. The initial instinct from say, president Macron's team, when they're confronted with some footage, for example, the footage of his wife slapping him would be to say it's all fake Russian imagery, something that is inaccurate, something that is misinformation or interference. And then when they're confronted with more information, they have to refine the narrative. So when you find yourself in a situation that you are running this platform like Telegram, and then you protect the freedom to express of ideas that don't go in line with the mainstream narrative, you often find yourself in this crossfire when the forces in power will say that you must be working with some foreign government that they don't like. Inevitably they would say that, oh, if you're protecting these voices, it's not right. They love you when you are protecting the freedom of speech in a country that is far from them, or better yet in a country that is their geopolitical rival. They praise you for that. But then they have this bipolar attitude when you do the same in their own country and they say, no, no, no, no, no, we loved you for protection, freedom of speech, but not here, not in my backyard. We don't need it here. We're all right, we have free press. And then you find yourself in this weird spot that Ukrainians say you work for the Russians. The Russians say you work for the Ukrainians and all this. Schizophrenia is something that we had to deal with for some time because it's, it's a very easy way to attack you at some point. You don't understand where it is coming from because is it our competitors? And we must give credit to our competitors if it's their invention to launch this kind of rumors because a certain point they must have realized they can't compete technologically on the product side, so they must do something like this. Or it's just governments launching these rumors, trying to discredit the platform, trying to scare their citizens away from it because they understand that their power and grip or their own country is in danger as long as they allow a pro freedom platform to operate."

Every time I meet somebody from one of these countries you mentioned in real life, people recognize me in the street, sit here in Dubai, they come over, they seem incredibly grateful and understanding the propaganda in each of these countries would tell them a number of things, but they learned to discount it. That's why they're so happy that Pilgrim exists is because the way they can understand the world around them is to receive conflicting, mutually exclusive viewpoints from sources that hate each other and try to understand what really is true because there's no such thing as an unbiased source of information. When the war in Ukraine story in 2022, I instantly realized Telegram is going to be used to spread propaganda by both sides. And I didn't want Telegram to be used as a tool for war. And I said, and I posted it publicly, I I suggested maybe we should just suspend the activity of all politics related channels in both countries for the time of the war. Maybe we shouldn't have channels in these two countries. And then interestingly, people from both countries revolted against this. They told me of people in Ukraine and in Russia that I don't get to babysit them and decide for them what sources of information that they have to be granted access to. They're grownups that can make these decisions for themselves. They understand that there is a lot of propaganda. They learn to see through this propaganda. They learn to be able to tell truth from lie. And in this time of war, it was particularly a valuable for them to receive as much information as possible because their relatives, their friends who are getting affected and are still getting affected, they want to understand what was going on. At that point when I realized people are smart, people get it, people can see through it. If you ask most people in any of these countries, do you agree that access to telegram should be restricted for whatever reason, they would say no."

Can you expand on this also, there's an interesting point that you made that everybody's weakness is also a strength. Everybody's strength is also a weakness.

In most cases, our bad traits and our good traits are the same trait or at least have the same source. Of course, there are some extreme examples, but I'd say 99% of people, if you analyze their character, their bravery can be seen in recklessness. In other situations, like in depending on circumstances, you would see exactly the same personality trait and it'll be either a good thing or a bad thing. Because humanity is perfect as a whole, And each of us is different for a reason. We have evolved to be different, to compliment each other's abilities so that together we're invincible. And even if you take a person as complicated as villain, I believe that certain traits that I demonstrates that people criticize about him are also the sources of his strength. For example, his emotionality is derive from the fact that he cares about issues deeply and he's willing to start as many worries and as many fights as it takes to change the world in the direction that he thinks is right. He also seems to be able to extract motivation from this war and personal conflicts, which is again, not something to be underestimated at a certain point in the life of a successful entrepreneur. The question of motivation starts to be the primary question. If we're talking about the richest person in the world and the most famous entrepreneur in the world, you have to wonder how does he motivate himself? And if starting a war on X debating certain issues or becoming personal with other CEOs, criticizing them, if these activities help heal to innovate and start new projects, he should be doing more of it. There's nothing wrong in being non agreeable. Actually. It's one of the main traits of a successful entrepreneur not agreeing with things and every time somebody like Elon, but there is no somebody like hi. It's just Elon think, at least from the entrepreneurs I know and I personally interacted with. He's unique in the sense that he keeps launching new things, running them in parallel. And he doesn't seem to be stretched too thin. Well, some people think he is, but he manages to still demonstrate success in all or most of his endeavors. So again, you can criticize I for being emotional, but would he be the same person without this? I doubt that."

So one of the interesting questions is here that we could talk for many hours about, but I'd love to get a high view picture. So you've, you've left what I understand what I think is a huge amount of money on the table by sticking to your principles. For example, not doing advertisement, that's based on user private data, which basically every social media company does. So the only advertisement that Telegram does is based on channels and groups based on the topic, not the private data of the individuals. And the other thing is, which is also gangster and incredible, is you don't do a news feed, which is the most addictive and engagement inducing aspect of social media, which feeds the very kind of addictive downside of the internet, the distraction, the engagement, drama, farming aspect that we've, we've talked about in the very beginning that you tried to resist that you think is damaging the human mind at scale. So anyway, that that's just speaking to the fact that you leaving a lot of money on the table. So how the hell were you able to be profitable? What are the ways to tell Grant makes money?"

Something that most of our competitors do do, because money has never been the primary goal. It's not for me. When I sold the remaining share of my first company, I had to do it below market price because I didn't leave Russia completely without any pressure. As you know, I reinvested the vast majority of everything in Telegram. Telegram is an operation that is losing money for me personally, I never, I didn't extract more from Telegram than I invested in it. I never sold a single share, but I also didn't want to sell to other. So how do you reach a point when you're profitable without sacrificing your values? One of the ideas we explored was a subscription model, but only for certain additional features. We wanted to keep all the existing features free and that just add more business related tools or tools for advanced users that they would have to pay for say four or $5 a month. It was quite unprecedented at the time. It wasn't considered a viable option for messaging apps to do that. We launched the premium subscriptions for Telegram in 2022 and now we have over 15 million paid subscribers. This is some very significant recurring revenue. So we would receive more than half a billion dollars from premium subscription salon this year and it's growing fast for that. We had to innovate a lot. We included over 50 different features into the premium package. And then how do you make an app that is already more powerful than any other other messaging app on the market, even more useful so that people would be ready to pay for this extra. That wasn't easy. That took a lot of effort"

Despite that we are also experimenting a lot with blockchain based technologies. We're the first app to allow people to directly own their username and their digital identities using smart contracts and NFTs removing Telegram from the picture. So for example, Telegram cannot confiscate your username from you. It's impossible. We do a lot of things related to the ecosystem of Telegram. We have a thriving mini app platform, millions of mini app developers launching their own bots and applications."

          "value": "2 (232m 56s):\nTo is a blockchain technology that we initially developed in 2018, in 2019. And we started to develop it because we needed a blockchain platform to be integrated deeply into Telegram. Because we believe in blockchain, we think it's one of the technologies that enable freedom. But at the time, if you look at Bitcoin, if you look at Ethereum, they were not scalable enough to cope with the load that our hundreds of millions of users will create. They would just become congested. And I asked my brother, can we create a blockchain platform that would be inherently scalable so that no matter how many users or transactions there are, it would split into smaller pieces, which we call short chains and would still process all transactions. And he thought for a few days and said, yes, it's, it's possible, but it's not easy. And we started building it. We ended up succeeding in developing that technology, but we couldn't release it because the A CC, the Securities and Exchanges Commission and the United States was unhappy with the way the fundraise for Don was conducted. So we had to abandon the project and the Open source community took over. Luckily because we constantly conducted those contests for third party developers. There was a thriving community around town, Which now stood for the Open Network as opposed to its prior name, telegram Open Network. And so this project got eventually launched without our direct involvement. And it's thriving now because everything we do, like I said, this blockchain based tokenized usernames, pilgrim accounts are all based on Don on, its in its smart contracts. It's the only way for third party developers and creators to withdraw the funds that they earn through our revenue sharing programs. For example, with channel owners, we do a 50 50 split of ad revenues. It's also the only way to transact on Telegram. For example, if you want to buy ads on Telegram, you, you should use Don all the new things we launch, for example, let's say gifts that we mentioned earlier, which you can define as a reinvented, socially relevant NFT integrated into a billion user ecosystem. But at the same time available on chain transferable, which you can own directly. Also based on time, incredibly fast growing space. We only launched them half a year ago. And now as a result of this Telegram gifts to has become I think the largest or the second largest blockchain in terms of NF daily NFT trading volumes."

We had to create over 50 distinctive versions of each. Yeah. And then each individual piece is unique because it also has unique backgrounds, unique icon and the background. It's something that we reinvented because we didn't like the old school NFTs. First of all, they were not relevant socially because okay, you have an NFT, where do you demonstrate it? And a Telegram, a Telegram gift is there next to your name. It's part of your digital identity on Telegram. And then you can create collections of gifts and show it off on your profile page. But it also, the other thing that we wanted to reinvent is the aesthetic part of it. Most NFTs are just ugly and they're not based on any other sophisticated technology. So what we did with s Snoop's gifts, I think represents an example of beautiful aesthetically pleasing and at the same time very accurate in terms of references to this specific artist's biography mixture between art and technology, which I think is quite rare. I'm quite proud of it. I think it's a new trend, a new phenomenon. It's only half a year old, so let's see where it goes. We are gonna select our next influencer or artist to be part of it."

I realized, you know, when you are trying to monetize social media platform in a way that is consistent with your values, you are forced to find ways that benefit your users, not exploit them. People love this gifts. People love the fact that they can congratulate a person close to them with something valuable and at the same time something beautiful. Also, some people make a business out of it, which is funny. They resell these gifts and we recently met a guy who earned several million dollars just from buying and selling gifts. It's a"

I think I bought at the local maximum, it's something like $700 per Bitcoin. And they just threw a couple of millions there. And a lot of people after Bitcoin later next year went down somewhere close to 300, 200, started to express their sympathy to me. Say, oh, you're a poor fellow. You made this horrible mistake investing in this new thing, but don't feel bad about it. We still have some respect for you. And my response to them were, I don't care. I'm not gonna sell it. I believe in this thing. I think this is the way money should work. Nobody can confiscate your Bitcoin from you. Nobody can censor you for political reasons. This is the ultimate means of exchange. And again, I'm now talking about Bitcoin, but it relates to cryptocurrencies in general. So I have been able to fund my lifestyle, so to say, from my Bitcoin investment. Some people think if I'm able to rent nice locations or fly private, it's because I somehow extract, extract money from Telegram. Like I said, telegram is a money losing operation. For me personally, Bitcoin is something that allowed me to stay afloat. And I believe it will come to a point when Bitcoin is worth $1 million. Just look at the, the trends. The governments keep printing money like no, tomorrow nobody's printing Bitcoin. There is a predictable inflation and then it stops. It's a certain point Bitcoin is here to stay. All the fiat currencies remains to be seen."

When you are running a big business or when you're running a large country, it's similar. You sometimes face this dilemma, what are you going to do this very horrible thing or this also very horrible thing. So I think the right answer to this riddle is not to do any of these things, reframe the question, design a solution that turns a disadvantage in an advantage, and then use it to cope with the other side of the problem. So do you know the answer to that? Ri"

What's, what's the what, what, why did you bring it with you everywhere? Is it kind of like, you know, in America they have a wishbone? Is it just the large wishbone because the wishbone brings you luck? And I should also point out that just like with telegram, with the art, there's tiny little walrus. And thanks to you, I had to also find out that a lot of mammals have a bone inside their penis. And the evolutionary advantage, I guess, of having a bone is quite obvious. And it, it actually raises the question of why humans don't have a actual bone inside their penis. A lot of questions there."

Ironically, it also translates in a very specific way into the Russian language. In Russian walrus penis means something a bit funny, which is often used to describe nothing. So for example, if you've being requested by say certain government or a certain business partner to provide something that you are not willing to provide, you can just politely have this penis bone in the background while you're doing the video call and hope that they would"

Because at a certain point in my life, about 15 years ago, I decided that it was a good idea to be a sperm donor. Initially, a friend of mine asked me to help because they were trying to have a baby with his wife, and they experienced certain health issues that prevented them to do it the natural way. And he asked me, we don't, he told me, we don't want to just rely on some random anonymous genetic material. We want somebody we know and respect to be the biological father of, of our kid. And I said, you gotta be kidding me. Sounds ridiculous what you been talking about. But then I realized it's, it's, it's actually a serious issue. And they were not the only couple struggling with that. So eventually I got persuaded into doing more of it. I, I can't say I'm incredibly proud of that, but I think it was the right thing to do, particularly at the time when I thought, okay, I probably don't have much time on this planet left. Things are getting trickier and trickier. So if I can help some couples have babies, let's do it. And then more recently when I was working on my will, I realized that I shouldn't make a distinction between the kids conceived naturally and the kids who are just my biological kids that I never seen as long as, as they can establish their shared DNA with me someday, maybe in 30 years from now, they have to be entitled for a share of my estate after I'm gone. And that made a lot of noise in the news. For some reason people get very excited by this kind of news. I got a lot of messages from people claiming they're my kids. I got a lot of requests from people ask me to adopt them. The memes were priceless. But understanding that, oh, it's not a thing that most people do, I don't see anything wrong with it. If anything, I think more people should be donating sperm."

Not of their own achievements, but of their father's achievements over their father's wealth. This removes the incentive to work on developing their own skills, removes the incentive to study to work. So I thought if they're gonna have this money, it should be something that they would only get when they're already adult. It's still risky, but one of the reasons I decided it makes more sense to divide this huge wealth that I'm likely to leave behind among a hundred or more than a hundred people is that it won't be too much for every single descendant. But at the same time, some people did the calculation, it's, it's, it's still many, many millions of dollars for each child. So I'm not sure it it helps too much."

It's an experiment from the 1960s and early seventies conducted by ethologist John B. Calhoun. And we can talk about this one for hours also, I'm sure. But it was an experiment with, with a few hundreds of individual mice compartments. And they provided them with unlimited food, water nesting, no predator, stable temperatures and frequent cleaning. Basically the definition of a buttons as far as mice go. And the interesting aspect of this experiment is that at first the population doubled. It grew very quickly, but then it leveled off. And certain really negative social things started happening. Like mothers neglected to kill their young violent attacks and hypersexual activity became widespread. Some quote unquote beautiful ones, largely inactive, well-groomed mice withdrew, refusing to made interact. So all of these kind of societal qualities that we see as negative from the functioning of a society started to emerge because of the abundance. And finally the collapse, the reproduction rates crashed, social dysfunction spread to the next generation and eventually just went extinct, extinct. It didn't just plummet to a low level. It, it plummeted steadily to zero despite the fact that those ongoing resource abundance as this description states, the last miles died surrounded by untouched food and water. So I mean there's deep wisdom to that about abundance. It seems, you've mentioned this in different contexts throughout this conversation is it seems like scarcity, it seems like constraints. It seems like non abundance is essential for human flourishing, which is a counterintuitive notion. It's true for mice, and I think it's probably true for humans too."

We seem as a species to lose our ability to identify purpose in a world where you have everything and everything lose its meaning. Restrictions are important. I think though, that they should be coming from within. It should be self restriction rather than a restriction in order to create purpose and meaning in life. In a way, I was lucky in a very counterintuitive way because I grew up poor. I didn't have money when I was a teenager. I had the same jacket for years, which was bought on a secondhand marketplace. My father wouldn't receive his salary as a university professor for months because the Russian state was almost bankrupt back then. My mom had to juggle two jobs to take care of us. It was not easy, but it also created purpose. It created meaning. It created priorities. It allowed us to focus on things that mattered. It allowed us to develop our character and intellectual abilities. Now, if we had everything, why do anything? This mice suffered societal, collapse, collapse that was irreversible. And this is not an accident. This kind of experiment has been repeated countless times. At a certain point, social dysfunction and the erosion of social roles becomes contagious and the society gradually degrades into a chaotic collection of individuals unable to take care of the next generation or even to produce the next generation. And it goes extinct."

The example he said to myself and my brother was priceless. Some people make this mistake of thinking that you can instill the right principles in the future generation or into your kids by saying things to them. But kids are smart. They discount words, they look at the actions. So observing our father was a big lesson by itself. It wasn't necessary for him to say anything to us. And then at the same time, he was incredibly patient, emotionally resilient. And you know, my mom, great woman, incredibly smart, highly educated, but she would sometimes try to test the patience of my father. And it's a straight rooted in our biology. It's a, it's an, there's an evolutionary explanation for that, that women sometimes tend to do that. And he demonstrated incredible patience all the time. He told me recently, you shouldn't give the wrong example to the people around you and in particular to your kids because you can do the right thing nine times out of 10, but you make a mistake once and they will instantly copy it. If you're telling your kids not to use a smartphone, but you're using a smartphone all the time yourself and coming up with all kinds of sophisticated, brilliant explanations why they shouldn't be using a smartphone, it won't land. It's bound to fail. So you lead by example. And there are other numerous lessons staying positive, looking at the bright side, never despair, be honest. And you know, he told me last time I spoke to him that AI can have consciousness, can be creative, but it, it cannot have conscience in a way cannot be moral. It cannot have deeply rooted principles. It cannot have integrity in the meaning that we understand it as human beings."

One thing most people agree on is that setting goals and staying positive and confident does allow you to achieve the things you wanna achieve. It's very hard to believe though, that you can just manifest things and to being without applying effort in the direction that seems to be logical. Maybe some people exist that can just sit on the bank of a river and materialize things by the power of the thought. But I'm not sure in one of these people always found it more easy to believe that if you couple this optimism and faith with logical action, then it is bound to be successful."

It's a nice way to visualize it that somehow our effort and our focus changes the things that are likely and less likely. And by focusing on it would make the thing more and more likely, at least as an estimate, as the kind of field that we, through our thoughts and through our actions change that field. And then there's 8 billion of us doing so and together there's this collective intelligence that creates the world we see around us Like, like the, like the mice.

People should look into it, which is very crisp, clean consequence of the many world's interpretation of quantum mechanics that we as conscious beings can't experience our death. We can only as we branch into these many, many worlds, only the living consciousnesses get to experience it. So in some sense, yeah, there's many universes. If we're to seriously take the many world's interpretation of quantum mechanics, there's many universes where you died many times, especially you, and I'm glad we're the in the universe where we get to share the table with this impressive bone, a little humor and a lot of serious topics covered today. Once again, I can't say enough. Aja, thank you for me and Aja thank you from hundreds of millions of people that follow your work for you fighting for the freedom of all of us to speak and creating a platform where we can do so.

          "value": "0 (274m 5s):\nThank you, brother. Thank you for listening to this conversation with Pavo Durov to support this podcast. Please Check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me try to articulate some things I've been thinking about. If you'd like to submit questions or topics like this for me to talk about in the future, Go to lex friedman.com/ama. I'd like to use this opportunity to talk about Franz Kafka, one of my favorite writers. The reason he has been on my mind is that his work, the trial and the case of Pavo Durov in France has, let's say eerie parallels, both metaphorically and literally. Of course, the trial is a work of fiction, but I think it is often useful to Go to the surreal world of literature, even of the over the top dystopian variety like 1984 Animal Farm, brave New World, the trial, the Castle Metamorphosis, even the Plague by Albert Kamo. All to better understand our real world and the destructive paths we have the potential to go down together, which also hopefully helps us understand how to avoid doing so. So lemme zoom out and speak about Franz Kafka. Who was he? He was an insurance clerk who wrote at night, he died young and almost completely unknown, and he asked for his manuscripts to be burned. Luckily for us, his friend, max Broad refused to do so giving us the work of what I consider to be one of 20th century's greatest writers. In his work, Kafka wrote about the cold machine-like reduction of humans to case files through the labyrinth of institutional power. He wrote about an individual's feeling of guilt even when a crime has not been committed or more generally. He wrote about the feeling of anxiety that is part of the human condition in our modern, chaotic world. His writing style was to use short, declarative sentences to describe the surreal and the absurd. And in so doing effectively, I think convey the feeling of an experience versus simply describing the experience. For example, famously his work, the metamorphosis opens with the following lines, as Gregor Samza awoke one morning from uneasy dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect. He was lying in his hard armor plated back, and when he lifted his head a little, he could see his dome like brown belly divided into stiff arched segments on top of which the bed quilt could hardly keep in position and was about to slide off completely his numerous legs, which were pitifully thin compared to the rest of his bulk waved helplessly before his eyes. Kafka, I think effectively uses this image of being transformed into a giant bug stuck on his back to convey a feeling of helplessness and uselessness this family to his job, to society. The feeling of being a burden to everyone dehumanized, alienated and abandoned the feeling of being only temporarily valued as long as he served some function for his job or for his family, and quickly discarded otherwise. I will probably talk about this work in more depth at another time because it is so haunting and I think it is such a profound description of the burden of existence in modern society for many people. But here, lemme talk about another of his work. The trial in this novel, the main character Joseph K is a successful bank officer and he's arrested on his birthday for an unspecified crime by a kind of amorphous court whose authorities everywhere and nowhere he navigates labyrinth like legal system where everyone knows about his case, but no one can really explain it. The so-called trial never actually occurs in any conventional sense. Instead, Joseph K's entire life becomes the proceedings leading up to the trial. In a sense, the trial is the state of being accused itself a permanent condition rather than a singular event. Kafka's genius in this work was to show that modern institutions don't need to hold trials, they just need to hold you in the permanent looming possibility of one public attention to this case, both positive and negative. 'cause Joseph KA feeling of constantly being judged by people around him. This wears at his mind and his psychological wellbeing begins to deteriorate in a sense the trial doesn't need to convict him. The internal psychological turmoil and the external social scrutiny performs a conviction and the eventual execution. When exactly one year after his arrest, Joseph K is visited by two men, walk him courteously through the city to an abandoned query and stab him in the heart Without Joseph k resisting. To me, the trial shows that tyranny final victory isn't one, it kills you, but when you hold still for the knife, not because you're forced, but because you've been exhausted into submission once again, it is a haunting story of the soullessness of bureaucracy in its suffocation of the human spirit. I highly recommend the short book and I'll probably talk about it even more in the future. I don't think it's especially useful for me to speak to any parallels between the trial and Paolo Doffs case because after all, the trial is a work of fiction. But on a positive note, let me report that as far as I saw, Pavo has maintained optimism and a general positive outlook throughout this whole process. What I always fear in such cases is that a bureaucratic system can wear people down, exhaust them into surrendering. I saw none of that with Pablo. I don't think he knows how to give up or give in, no matter how much pressure he's under. Again, this is truly inspiring to me. Also, now that we're talking about it, let me mention some other of Kafka's work that was moving to me. The castle has similar description as the trial does of the absurd inaccessibility of those in authority of the nightmarish bureaucracy. The character in the castle is also named Kay. Both bureaucracies operate through exhaustion, endless deferrals procedures, waiting rooms, again, highly relevant to modern times. I can also highly recommend Kafka's in the penal colony and hunger artists. Both are two interesting and weird to explain in depth here. But lemme say The Hunger Artist is a story that I think is relevant to our modern day attention economy, where so many people want to be famous. It tells the story of let's say, professional faster who performs starvation in a cage as entertainment and he slowly loses his audience to newer spectacles. So much so that eventually when he starves himself to death, nobody cares. Kafka's work is heavy. It serves as a warning for the nightmare that civilization can become. And yet I think it is also a source of optimism because when we can recognize elements of our own world in Kafka stories, when we can see elements of our institutions in the trial or in the castle, when we can see ourselves in Gregor Samza, we're not just diagnosing the disease, we're proving that we're still human and wise enough to see it and name it. Kafka gave us the goal to resist against such systems that tried to dehumanize us and to ensure that individual freedom and the human spirit keep flourishing. I think it will. I have faith in us humans. I love you all."

It is a book that two legendary historians, Ian Kershaw and Anthony Beaver give very high praise to Ian Kershaw, describes it as very well researched, serious piece of scholarship. And Anthony Beaver describes it as remarkable work of research and it is indeed a remarkable work of research. Norman went deep into the archives using primary sources to uncover a perspective on Hitler in the Third Reich that is before this, but mostly ignored by historians. He also wrote Tripped Nazi Germany, the CIA, and the Dawn of the Psychedelic Age, and he's not working on a new book with the possible title of Stoned Sapiens. Great title, looking at the history of human civilization through the lens of drugs. And now a quick few second mention of each sponsor.

So that desk, you see sort of me place my hands on that wooden color desk, that's UPLIFT Desk. And I've had those for many years and I've enjoyed them for many years. Long, long, long before they became a sponsor. I'm a huge supporter of what they do. I'm a huge supporter of the product they create. I spend so much time behind a desk that really, you might be silly to say, but things like a desk or a Kinesis keyboard are sources of little and big moments of happiness throughout the day and the days add up to weeks and the weeks add up to years until a lifetime. And so the amount of happiness that UPLIFT Desk has brought me is, is a lot measurable, really. I'm sitting behind an UPLIFT desk now as I'm recording this. Anyway, they have a huge number of combinations, the sizes and colors and all that kind of stuff that you can pick.

In part because of the incredible conversation I had with the legendary DHH. He is a person, he's a programmer, he's an entrepreneur, as a philosopher, as a human inspires me, and he and Shopify work closely together. Obviously, we talked a lot about Toby, the CEO, Shopify. It's an incredible company. The engineering behind the company is incredible. And if you haven't listened to that episode and you're at all interested in programming, you should. 'cause if you're not interested in Ruby on Rails, first of all, it's very likely that you will be by the end of the episode, but you at least we'll get a chance to listen to a human being that sees the beauty in the programs he creates. So to know that a little bit of that love went behind the engineering of Shopify is really great to know. Anyway, it is also a company and it is also a company that helps companies Sell stuff online. So you should sign up for a $1 per month trial period at Shopify dot com slash lex. That's all lowercase. Go to Shopify dot com slash lex to take your business to the next level today."

You can read bait articles about what it's like to start a business, well to grow a business. But so much of that information, quite honestly, from the bottom of my heart is bullshit. You have to talk to other leaders, you have to talk to other CEOs that have done it, that are doing it. They're in the middle of the battle. Anytime I talk to somebody like Jason Calis, who I'm a big fan of, and he's here in Austin now aside of course from the All In podcast that I'm also a fan of, he's the host of this week in startups that I recommend you listen to. The reason I bring that up is because he has seen and he has helped so many people in that battle of creating a business, of growing a business. And it's so fun to talk to him because he has a lot of wisdom about the different ways to do it. And that's what I'm trying to get at, is you need to talk to the people that have done it, that are not 5, 10, 20 years ago, but are doing it now. And that's what Hampton is good at. It connects you with other people that are in the midst of that battle and you could have candid conversations with them. They have groups forming in New York City, Austin, San Francisco, la, Miami, Denver, and other top cities nationwide. Quit reading the bullshit online and go talk to actual founders, actual people that are building high growth companies. Find your group at join Hampton dot com slash lex. That's join Hampton dot com slash LEX."

The Nazi movement basically started, and it started in Bavarian beer halls. So alcohol was the drug of choice of the early Nazi movement. The only guy that didn't drink was Hitler. He was a tea toler, I guess you say. So that was happening in Munich. So alcohol and national socialism are very closely connected at the same time. In the twenties in Berlin, there was a completely different thing going on. People were taking all kinds of drugs. This had to do actually with the defeat of Germany in the First World War. I mean, the context is a big context. The Versailles Treaty had the effect that the Germany economy was not really able to recover after the end of World War I. The Versailles Treaty was written basically by the western victorious powers. Germany had no say in the negotiations, and I'm certainly not a German nationalist, not even a German patriot. But even I would say that the Versailles treaty treated Germany somewhat unfair. I mean, it laid all the blame on Germany. And I mean, a war is a very complex thing. And the first World War, to examine how it actually started is a very complex, you know, story. And there's many factors to it. But the Versailles said it was Germany's fault, and then Germany had to do all these payments to the allies. It couldn't create a new economy, it couldn't have a new army. So it was, the economy really went down. Everything in Berlin was cheap and the people were using also substances that were very cheap in huge quantities. So while in Bavaria they were drinking alcohol and alcohol in the brain stimulates behavior a a group behavior, us against them, you can actually examine this as a neuroscientist would know exactly how this works. While in Berlin, the drugs that were used were morphine, there was Cocaine, there was masculine, there was ether. So people were experimenting. Everyone developed a different mindset. It was all, you know, you didn't behave in a way that some kind of authority would like you to behave in because the authority had just lost the first world war. And there was no, no real authority in Berlin. People were doing whatever they wanted to do and they were intoxicating themselves in the way they wanted to do it. So the population, in a way, if you just look at Munich and Berlin was growing apart, like there were the alcohol people in Munich, the Nazis, and then there were these weird diverse A-G-B-T-Q whatever scene in Berlin, like actresses sniffing Ethan in the morning and then making crazy moves."

You know, you had to, you, you couldn't, you couldn't go crazy, you know, as a young person, you couldn't be a young person. But now in the Weimar Republic in the twenties, you could, no one stopped you. So people went crazy. Like that's what made Berlin into the city, that it still somehow is. And maybe later we talk about contemporary Berlin. It kind of, it, it, it still has that vibe, you know, that's why people still come to Berlin. Drugs are cheap, you can move however you want, there's no authority. So that created a rift between the Nazis in Munich, and they always hated Berlin and what was going on in Berlin. So for example, Gobel, the later propaganda minister, he called the situation in Berlin reality, the hated asphalt reality of Berlin. He hated that. And when the Nazis then were able to take power in 19 33, 1 of the first things they did was to really prosecute people who were taking drugs because they wanted to, you know, bring everyone back into the fold. And I think that's, you asked what was the reason for people taking so many drugs? They were accessible, they were cheap. But I think the most important thing is that they, they let you find yourself maybe, or lose yourself, you know, also possible, you know. Can"

I wrote my first novel in New York, and I loved New York before Giuliani became mayor, it was, he ruined the city before that. It was not gentrified, let's say he introduced gentrification. And gentrification is a big topic. I I still lived in the un gentrified New York City for like 300 bucks a month rent. And everyone I knew was an artist. You loved the diversity of it.

But he's an pretty, he's an amphetamine writer on the road, was apparently written in two weeks on amphetamines and, but it's good, you know, amphetamines are not bad per se. We can also talk about this so-called bad drugs, you know, because basically they're neutral, but let's not lose the thread. Yes, yes. Even though New York was New York Berlin. Yes. Oh yeah. And then I was in New York, I was in a health food store, one of the first, like there weren't health food stores back then a lot, but there was one on First Avenue. And suddenly there was an announcement, which was unusual in the health food store, I think it was called Prana Prana Foods. And the announcement was that Kurt Cobain had just shot himself. It was like, and I had been actually, and still am a Nirvana fan. I've, I've seen one of the last concerts of Nirvana in New York City. And it was amazing. But he killed himself. And like the next day I received a music cassette from a friend of mine from Berlin with electronic music. And I realized that there had been a paradigm shift. Obviously rock music with the hero on stage was dead now it was, you know, dance electronic music, which a lot of people today think it's kind of simplistic music form, but it's actually a very highly intelligent music form. At least it was in the nineties. People were really experimenting with that music. That was the new music. That was actually the reason I moved to Berlin, really. I decided I leave New York City, I'm gonna move to Berlin. And then in Berlin, to answer your question, I fell in love with something that probably reminded me of the twenties, even though I wasn't there in the twenties. But that really, the city was very open. The wall had just was still, you know, I mean it's a few years later, but still the wall, it felt like it just came down. There was Germany was, Berlin was not yet the capital of Germany that was still in Bon. So Berlin was a very cheap and cultural and crazy city. Probably a bit like in the twenties actually. And that's how I fell in love with it. And that's how I became interested in this electronic scene. I mean, I, I visited many dance venues then called so-called clubs."

It was for right wing populist people like communists wouldn't use it, even though communists are in many ways quite similar to the right wing, especially back then. But it was used by right wingers and Hitler didn't mind because people who are drunk are more susceptible to right wing populism, I would claim now here, and Hitler would agree, so he, he, he did not think it was bad that these people were a bit drunk or maybe even very drunk, because if you're drunk, you also get aggressive against others.

And actually the first time the Nazis tried to grab power was the so-called beer hall put, I mean, that's an historical event took place in 1923. And it was after a drunk night where they suddenly decided, now we're gonna do it. So they came out of the Burger Boy killer, and they were all drunk except of Hitler, and they just tried to overtake the Munich government, and they miserably failed because it was just a stupid drunk idea. Like, they were like, yeah, let's just do it. And the Bavaria police quite sober that day. They just, you know, shut him to the ground. Hitler was almost killed. Like he just jumped behind his bodyguard ing during the bial pooch was wounded in his stomach with a, I think a gunshot. That's why he became a morphine addict. So this bial pooch in 23 had and severe effects also. They were sentenced to prison. And Hitler wrote mine Come in prison. All of"

His, his, this is not serious history, but it's, you know, even Hitler was a person, you know, and if you understand, for example, the substance abuse of a person, of course you understand more about that person. And historians never had had that idea before. Kershaw, for example, who's really a great, he's very knowledgeable about national socialism. Like many British historians, they always know more about German history than the German historians. But Kershaw really does. I think he's, he's really good. But in his biography of Hitler, he just writes one sentence like, and then he had a crazy doctor called Morrell who gave him dubious medications and drugs.

          "value": "2 (24m 39s):\nThat was very surprising to me. You know, I didn't know this myself. I never planned to write this book. It's ba it, it kind of happened to me. And I decided to team up with the leading German historian on national socialism, Hans Momon, who has passed away by now. He was quite old, but quite ready to be my mentor for this book, Blitzed. And he was maybe even shocked when I came back from the military archive of Germany with like a, like a lot of copies all relating to the systematical drug use of the German army, including an experiment done by the Navy who had always pretended to be the clean German, we say VA weapon. Like you have the army, you have the air force, you have the navy, you have, and the Germany, they had the Ss and the Navy always pretended to be like, we weren't really Nazis. We were like, you know, the German Navy we had, we had our ethics code. But I found in the archive that the Navy did human experiments in the concentration camp of s and Hausen trying to find a new wonder drug because they had new, what they called wonder weapons or what Hitler called wonder weapons. He always talked about these wonder weapons, wonder weapons were basically mini submarines, one or two people going in, staying underwater for up to a week. And torpedoing, you know, allied ships. So the Navy was trying to do, to develop a drug that would keep you awake and combat ready for seven days and seven nights without sleep and without, you know, burning out. Very difficult to find. So they hired penalty unit in the concentration camp they hired the ass, had the so-called shoe walking unit, it was a penalty unit, the concentration camp, testing shoe soles for the German shoe industry, walking for like days. And then they would measure like how the soles, you know, kept up in the stress. And they had different layers in the concentration camp, like all the, all the, the surfaces that German soldiers would touch when they conquer Europe. So this is a very elaborate thing, you know, and if you Go to the concentration camp today, it's a museum. You can still see that running track of the shoe runners unit. So the Navy hired the shoe runners unit from the Ss, paid them money and then gave them drugs, different kinds of drug combinations, Methamphetamine, combined with Cocaine and you know, chewing gum and like all kinds of things. So this is a, this is a big thing, you know, and there's documents to it and moms and who knew everything about national socialism, the old, you know, authority. And I'm like the young, like I didn't study history, I just, you know, I just try to make sense, you know, but I present him all these documents he's reading like from this pill patrol. And he said, wow. Like he said, we historians, we never do drugs. We don't understand drugs. This, we missed this. You know, so he was very clear that we missed this. And he said this is actually the missing link that historians did not have, especially to explain Hitler's degeneration as a leader. Like he, he, he made very good decisions, good in meaning militarily effective decisions in the beginning of the war and very bad decisions for the German war effort towards the end. And you, you can, you can link that to drugs, you can explain a lot of Hitler through the drugs. But you can also look at this point that historian so far had not been able to, to figure out basically what happened to Hitler. Why did he get crazy? And I mean, he was crazy or he was, but why did he get so bad as a leader? Because he was very effective for a long time. And then there's this moment where it, where it turns,"

And we should also say that some of the historians you mentioned, Ian Kershaw and Anthony Beaver, these legends of history, they all gave you compliments. So Kershaw said that your work is very good, extremely interesting in a serious piece of well researched history. Anthony Beaver said that it's a remarkable work of research. So props to them. You have received a bunch of criticism from historians, but you've also received obviously a lot of props. I mean, Kershaw's, the legendary historian Hitler, complimenting how deep your work is. That's, that must feel good. Maybe, maybe this is a good moment to also just, since we're talking about historians, to address some of the criticism. So Richard Evans has been also a great historian, has been one of the bigger critics. He said that your work is crass and dangerously inaccurate account and is morally and politically dangerous. I think that's grounded in the idea that if you say that, well all the Nazi forces and Hitler was on drugs, so therefore they're evil can be, they're not really evil, it's just accountability can be removed because they were using drugs."

Because it's, there's, there is some, I mean, I should say there is something really compelling about a singular theory that explains everything.

We don't want to put everything into Berlin again, like the Nazis did. We try to avoid our mistakes. So the military archive is in Freiburg.

By now we know a little bit more that Methamphetamine is not so healthy because you get used to it and you burn out and you, you get depressed and then you have to take more big problem. And he became depressed and burned out. And he didn't realize it's because of the meth that he is like describing to the whole German army. Like he was, he, he made a convincing case and I can explain that in detail, how that actually happened. But just to have his war diary was great. And then also like he would write, he would type letters writing to the company of Tela, how fast they could produce stuff in which time. So you have, you have all these original documents, you have like 500 documents and it goes like, he writes like reports what happened in this battle on Methamphetamine. Like there's a lot of stuff you've confined in the archives if you find them. But the tricky thing is that you can only look, you could you kind of look at a so-called find book in the find book. You cannot type in drugs. It wouldn't find anything because at the time when they were taking all the notes from this doctor, his ward dive, everything, they didn't put the label drugs there. They put the label, his name, his position, world War ii, French campaign, stuff like that. So, because at the time they didn't know that I would at one point come and look for drugs in that, you know, but he was the drug guy. But also they didn't realize he was the drug guy. You know, no one realized that he was the drug guy. So it's not easy to find stuff in the archives. So the archives you go, it's a very, it's a tough guy experience. You go into this building and you have to understand the rules and you will never fully understand what's going on. Also the archive is they don't really know what's going on. 'cause there's so many documents, no one's read them all, you know, no one knows. Like there's history kind of lying there, somehow organized, somehow stored."

He knows his drugs. And one day he said to me, when I was trying to figure out what I would write about next, he said, the Nazis took a lot of drugs, you should write about that. And I said, the Nazis didn't take drugs because you know, when you grow up in Germany, you get educated about the Nazis quite intensely. Especially in West Germany. Like they teach you everything but they don't teach you drugs. I mean now they do, maybe, you know, but it was not known. So, and, and the Nazis always had this, this aura of being law and order. No drugs of course, no chaos, everything. My grandfather, he was a Nazi, always said, well at least there was discipline in the country that was law and order. So this, this doesn't match with drugs, you know."

And he found Peavine tablets inside, which were the Methamphetamine product that was marketed in Germany in the late thirties. And this guy, the antique dealer took some tablets and they were quite old, you know, 70 years old. But they still had an effect on him. And I later asked him and he s he said, well we took them for about a month. It was the greatest month we ever had. Like we had so much fun, we were so productive. Yeah.

Then I took another one and then it's, you know, I could feel more. And then I took a third one. It's like typical Alex, he would like take three, you know? Yeah. Instead of just taking one, he's take, he took three Methamphetamine tablets from the forties. And he said, and then I felt like, and he looked at the river and there was a big like big ship, like a cargo ship going by. And he said, I felt like this ship suddenly there was a soup he said in German, like a, a motion that was like energy that was grabbing me. And I could like, I felt so powerful and he told me this and I was like, whoa, this is like, and I googled like Methamphetamine Nazi Germany. This was in 2010. And there was this one professor at the university in who said the Blitzed league was only possible because of Methamphetamine. So I called up this guy and he said, sure, I'll meet you. And then I, he gave me the signature for the archive and then I went to the archive and then I really started to do my own research. And then I went to different archives and I tried to find everything on Nazis and drugs. And that came, everything is in the book. So that crazy meeting with Alex in my writing tower that kind of got me on this research journey."

And I think that also there are archives that are not open, let's say the Vatican archive Some secret archives that some very powerful structures have structures that we might not even know, you know, now off the top of our head. Which still have a huge influence. So I think that the human history is quite different from what most historians write. I think that's, that's just one version. I think there's several versions and I think that it goes much deeper and is much more interesting. And so I asked like this history is a very active thing, which I also didn't know. You know, I was writing historical non-fiction book and I suddenly realized that this is like a shark pool. Like because the history defines the future or is very connected, our history teacher always said, if we don't know where we come from, we cannot know where we go. And that is, that is I think true. That is what I now really am interested in for my next book. I'm trying to really understand human history and obviously I'm not the first, there's a few, you know, alternative historians that go like, 'cause you have to go back in time quite a bit. And then it's, it's not easy to to write about it. But it's very interesting to think about it. And I would love to find like the truth on Atlantis, which I don't believe in actually. And we can also talk about that. But maybe there's an archive where we can actually see that they had this king ruling. I don't think this could be found, but I, I think we, we can still also find a lot of documents, but I think especially in in closed archives. So we won't find them."

That's revisionist history at its best. There's revisionist history has a sort of negative connotation sometimes 'cause you Go to conspiratorial land without much evidence and you're just being a rebel for rebel's sake.

          "value": "2 (46m 31s):\nWell the Nazis managed to grab power on January 30th, 1933. And they immediately become an anti ruck regime. That is important to them because the only intoxication they allow from now on in Germany is the Nazi intoxication, is the ideological intoxication. So they quickly install concentration camps, which were at the time run by the sr, not the Ss. Takes over later and turns the concentration camps into an industry. The first SR concentration camps were in sellers in Berlin or in, in the countryside. And some of the first people that landed in these cellars and were disciplined were drug users. Also anti-Semitic policies, which were very important from the day one for the Nazis. Like they, antisemitism is the, is the defining pillar of national socialism. The core of it really, they quickly connected anti-drug policies with anti-Semitic policies. They claim the Jews in Germany, the German Jews were taking more drugs than the non-Jew, the non-Jewish Germans. And national Socialism's goal was to purify the German body. So they saw the whole fo the, the the count, the fo folk, the country, the people as a body, one body. And that has to be purified. So all Jews are poisoned, but not only Jews, everyone who thinks differently communists are also poisoned. Jews are the worst poison. But you know, a lot of, you know, yeah. Then you create this clean body and obviously drugs play, have no position in that. If you are addicted to drugs, that's weak. You know, your morphous, you, you use Cocaine, that's all degenerate. That's Jewish, that's Jewish doctors, they're all morphous, you know? So that Nazi Germany and Hitler was the shining example of the person who doesn't take drugs. He was, he didn't have a private life. He didn't even have, he didn't even have a body. He just led the, the, the, the folks' body, you know. So Hitler was on not putting any poisons into him. He stopped smoking cigarettes in the twenties already. He never touched alcohol. Vegetarian. Vegetarian, no caffeine even. So he was, that's what he was in the beginning story of course changes at a certain point in time. But he started as this, as far as you understand. That's true. Yeah. In the beginning, I'm pretty sure, I'm pretty sure that it, this is true. Also, vegetarianism was a right wing thing in Germany. It was an elitist thing. If you were a vegetarian, you had a higher frequency, which kind of gave you superiority over let's say like these workers who need like to eat the sausage so you can, you know, do the work. Like Wagner, the composer, he was a vegetarian. Hitler was impressed by Wagner. So vegetarianism all, I think that's all true. I think Hitler was like that. And, and it's hard to be like that actually. And I think that gave him an attraction inside the movement to all like drunk, you know, drunk and girl and using morphine all the time because he of his pain and got used to morphine. So they were, it was not, the movement wasn't like this, but he was like this. So he was, he symbolized, but he symbolized that whole approach of cl cleanliness. Like purity. So then how does Methamphetamine come into the picture? It's totally absurd. That's why I thought it was fun researching this because it doesn't make sense, you know? And you know, they use this simple trick by, you know, defining what is a drug, an illegal drug and what is not, because drugs don't have it written on them. This is an illegal dangerous drug. You know, drugs are basically neutral. These are, these are molecules, you know. So the meth, Methamphetamine molecule was found in a Berlin based company called the Tela Company. And the head of Tela, he was very upset with the Olympics in 1936 because an Afro-American athlete, Jesse Owens, was running faster than German superheroes with the best genes. You know, how could, how can this be? So they thought that he was on something, 'cause he won I think five gold medals. It was ridiculous. You know, this was supposed to be Germany's games, you know, and then the Afro-American runs better than the, than the air and Uber men. So the only explanation is he took a drug, he took probably Zarine, which was a legal amphetamine. And also there were no doping checks at the Olympics. And if you take an amphetamine, of course you can run a bit faster maybe that, you know, when it kicks in that this has to do with the immense release of, of dopamine in the brain. But it was never proven that Owens used any type of drugs. But the head of the telar company, he said, we have to prevent this. We have to invent a better amphetamine. We have to, we have to make a German amphetamine that is stronger than the American benzine. So his main chemist, Hal Fritz Hal, he did research and he found that in 1917 in Tokyo, a Japanese chemist had made Methamphetamine meth. And he remade that Methamphetamine and they tested it among themselves, the chemist in the Berlin pharmaceutical lab. And they loved it. Like they made pure Methamphetamine. And you know, they had a really good time and they were like more active, they would talk it to, because that's what happens on Methamphetamine. So the company really thought, this is a great product. And they turned it into a product. They went to the patent bureaucracy and got the patent for Methamphetamine. And then it quite quickly came onto the market. It was labeled as Pavi, which is kind of a great name because it has like the perverse already in it. And this Pervitin perver was available in any pharmacy. So you just, you didn't need a prescription, a child could go and buy 10 packs of pure Methamphetamine. So Methamphetamine was also very cheap. So it became quite popular because people, you know, talked about it. Did"

I mean, it is a drug, but we don't think of it as a drug. You know, it's legal. And this was kind of how meth was treated in Germany. It was normal to use it. Like you had a, a very important business meeting, of course you would take a ine there's a, a movie by Billy Wilder called 1 2 3. Very good movie. And he shows the American executive, it was, it, it, the movie said right after the, the end of the second World War. So we see like, I think it's a Coca-Cola Executive American, and he says to his secretary, how should I have the morning coffee? I think half of a peavine. So peavine was also normal. It wasn't stigmatized. It was, it, it it was not the American just say no propaganda where your teeth fall out. And I mean, it was a German quality product. People liked it. Of course they did tests at universities like, but most of them were quite positive. Like yeah, it reduces your fear today. We might, you know, look for different things. But this was also a performance driven totalitarian society moving towards war. So if someone takes pein and says in the clinical tests at the university, I have, I'm not afraid of anything anymore. So that's positive. That's actually what got the guy who worked for the German army interested because he read university reports. I I also saw all of these reports. They were also in the military archive. So he's like, okay, you're not afraid anymore. If you take Methamphetamine, you don't need to sleep anymore. You don't need to eat so much 'cause your appetite is lowered. Like this is perfect for a soldier. So negative effects only became public in 1940 when the first ine opponent, he was actually a relative of Alba spe Hitler architect and later armament arm arms minister, he was the, the SPE psychologist. He was the first one who said, wait a minute, first of all, Methamphetamine is against the n Nazi ideology. 'cause now we're all taking a drug to be high performers. We have to be high performers without a drug. And he also said, you, you know, this, the obvious, this is gonna make you addicted, et cetera. This will, you know, create a tolerance. So only then the first negative reports came out before that what Tela did and then what the universities did, they all thought Methamphetamine is really good."

          "value": "2 (56m 28s):\nWell, professor Aranka was employed by the army. So it was his job to find things that would improve the performance of the German soldier. I always imagine him like a, a James Bond character like q who developed like gadgets and stuff. 'cause he also developed gadgets. So he was quite a, you know, he was an academic, but he was also a soldier. You know, he was employed, but he was basically running this institute, examining it. And he was so convinced that Pavi pein is the answer to his question. How to beat the main opponent of the German soldier. And that was not the British soldier, not the French soldier. Not the Russian soldier that was fatigued. He had been looking for a way to keep a soldier awake longer. So when he read these reports from universities, he did his own tests in the military academy with young medical officers. They came together at 8:00 PM in the evening. And then they received either Methamphetamine, caffeine pill, or placebo or zarine, like had different experiments. And he always concluded at the end, like at, like they started at 8:00 PM and like at 10:00 AM in the morning one time he notes the ine. People still wanna go out and party. Well, like the, the caffeine guys are like sleeping on the bench. And the, you know, it was clear that INE is strongest. It gives you the most energy, lets you work for the longest time. So he was convinced, but his superior, like the surgeon general of the German army, he was like an old school dude. And he was like, he didn't even react to these like Han would write letters. We have to use a synthetic drug in the next campaign, which was against Poland, which he knew about. And 'cause ine was quite known in the civil society, people were using it already. So he said, he even said a lot of soldiers will just take it with them and we should, we should control that, we should make it an official drug. But the surgeon general didn't understand. He, he didn't reply. So Germany attacked Poland without a clear like regulatory system on Methamphetamine. And indeed a lot of soldiers used it. And what Rka then wa did was he requested from all of the medical officers in the field in Poland, the war was over after a few weeks. So, but the German army was occupying Poland. He said, send me all back reports and tell me what did, did your people take tine and what were the effects? And he collected all these reports, which are also studied in the military archive. And he came to the conclusion, this is a really good fighting drug. And it probably is because people are still using it today. Methamphetamine is still being used and ran discovered this. He had, he had everything in front of him and Poland was beaten. And then Hitler wanted to attack the west. And the west was a different story than Poland. 'cause the West was the world empire of Great Britain combined with La Granda Army, the strongest army in the world, a French army. These two combined, you know, how can you win that Poland, they could overpower they had, you know, better army than Poland. But is the German Wimar really better than both of these armies combined? His officers didn't think so. High command said, no, we're not gonna attack the West. We're gonna lose. And Hitler, Hitler was fanatic about it. He really wanted to attack it. They were planning a coup against him in November, 1939, just to prevent him ordering the attack on the West, because it would've been a catastrophe for, for Germany. 'cause they really cared. You know, if you're a a high command, you don't wanna start a war that you're gonna lose, you know, very bad. He"

          "value": "2 (60m 53s):\nBut the French he really hated. And France had been the app, find the genetic enemy of the German people, at least right wingers would say. So there had been two wars. The first one Germany had won, then First World War, Germany had lost. So Hitler wanted to kind of revenge and also stop the Versai Treaty. So he really needed to attack the west, at least in his, in his mindset. But it was an irrational decision and that's why High Command said, no, we're not gonna do it. Basically. And Hitler's position at the time was not that he could do anything he wanted. I mean, high command is still a high command of the German Wimar. That's a very old, you know, it's, it's a, it's a tradition. It's, they, they, they do whatever they they want, you know, but also they have to obey Hitler's order. So it's a, it's a power struggle, basically. But to invade France was a totally stupid idea, but it changed. In the morning, on the morning of February 17th, 1940, Hitler invited three young tank generals to his office. And they had a plan, which was the plan to go through the Aden Mountains. That was the victorious idea. So it's not the drugs actually that idea to go through the Den Mountain, if you, if you thinks you would say that's the reason, that idea was genius. And Hitler immediately understood it, because before the plan was to attack in the north of Belgium, which is the same as World War I and you, it, it comes a stalemate and they fight for months and no one really moves. And it's bloody and it's, nothing's happening, it's bad. But that was the only plan that they had. That's why the high command said, no, we're not gonna do it. It's stupid. But these three tank generals, they had kind of like, somehow they were able to snuck into Hitler's office and they said, look, if you, if we go with the whole army through the Aden Mountains, and like Hitler had, this is not possible. This is like a mountain range. How can the whole German army fit through this eye of a needle, basically? And they said, no, we can do it. Because everyone misunderstands what tanks can do. Tanks are not slow machines in the back that kind of wait for the action to happen. And then, you know, I don't know, support this somehow we are gonna use tanks in the front as race cars. Basically. We are gonna overpower the enemy. We are gonna be in France before the French, who are stationed all with the, with the British in, in Northern Belgium, and also on the Maj line, but not really in the Aden Mountains. That was hardly fortified because no one could imagine that Germany would go through there. And before they know it, we are already behind them basically. We are already in France and they're still hanging out in northern Belgium because it takes quite a while, you know, to travel. This was a different time also. So that he was convinced and he then ordered the attack. The attack would happen. And that is then. And, but the, it would only work if you would reach sedan, the border city of France within three days and three nights. So the whole army, or at least, you know, the avant-garde of the, of the, of the machinery had to be like a big part of the army had to be in sedan after three days and three nights. And that was only possible if you don't stop. And that was the problem. The sleep was really then suddenly became a huge problem. And Hitler said, when I was fighting in World War, I, of course I could stay awake for a week. I'm a German, you know, even though he is not even German, he's Austrian. But that was a problem. But suddenly Aranka realized that his moment had come because he had the recipe, how people could stay awake for three days and three nights. So Rka suddenly became, before that he was kind of an outsider, like the freak with the drug idea. Suddenly he became like, okay, tell us how does it work? And he gave like lectures in front of the officers and he wrote a stimulant decree where like a whole army is prescribed a drug in this case Methamphetamine. How much should be taken and what intervals, what are the side effects? So this was a, this became a very big thing. And then Tela had to deliver 35 million dosages to the, to the front lines, which were, no, not the front yet. I mean it was, they, they were stationed in, in the west of Germany. And then on May 10th they took their Methamphetamine and they started the surprise attack through the Aden Mountain. So"

And I read a report when ramen high on meth, like at night doesn't stop, of course, because they all, you know, they don't stop at night. But every army usually stops at night. So the French army were stopping. They were in a village camping out and the German ramer was going with the tank through that village, with his division just running over people. And he was standing like in the open lid of the tank. And he was like going through that thing, you know, and you know, like a berserk type of, you know, warrior. And that was when, that to me is a war crime. That that is when the, when the wimar lost its innocence in that push of, of Ramel through the French countryside. 'cause you don't do that, you know, your enemy sleeping. 'cause the French also had a drug regulation. They received three quarters of a re of a liter of red wine per man per day. So at, of course at night they're gonna be sleepy on red wine. And the Germans were like on meth and they were just running over them. There's descriptions of the chains of the tank becoming bloody. I don't think he did it. And he was like, oh my God, what did I just do? I'm sorry. You know what, what am I doing here? He was in the, in the movie. You know, this"

So you can choose, you know, concentration camp or you just join the ranks and then you get ine and then you invade France. There was a trial in Germany because someone said all soldiers are murderers. And I think then the German bundes were like, sued him. No, soldiers are not murderers. And he actually won in court.

And you know, they didn't understand what they're signing up for. And they were told that they're free to leave once they understand what they're doing. And many of them didn't and they didn't have hate for Jews or for the people who are, they're murdering. You are again a 19, 20-year-old young kid.

And because you might become a genocidal murderer, you know, that might happen. Like are you responsible? I would say you are responsible, but that's just my personal gut feeling. Like I always thought my grandfather was responsible for the genocide. 'cause he was working for the German railway system and he once saw a train car full of Jews in a cattle wagon. And he only said to me, yeah, this was against German railway regulations. And I said, so what did you do? And he said, well, there were ss at the station where I was working and I was too, too scared. I didn't do anything. So I thought that he was, he, he made himself guilty. I thought that's, and my father for example, reacted very strongly because of that. He never called him by his first name, the, the father of his wife. 'cause he still had that, you know, he was a Nazi 'cause he was working for the railway. So I wouldn't excuse, I wouldn't excuse people actually. And I certainly would not excuse high ranking politicians that make policies because the, the genocidal policies that the Nazis developed, the war policies that they developed had nothing to do with drugs. And I never write that in any, you know, because there's no documents. If I would find documents that say yeah, when we, you know, but this, the Nazi ideology has nothing to do with drugs, maybe with alcohol, you know, but it's, and and I spoke with my father who had been a high judge in Germany, what does actually the law say? And the law says if you plan a crime, and then maybe when you commit it, you are under the influence. It does not diminish your responsibility. Your responsibilities only diminish. Let's say you are a totally normal person, never done any harm to anybody. And suddenly you take a drug that, or you totally drunk and you don't know what you're doing and you kill someone, then a judge could say, maybe you have a lesser responsibility. But this is not the case with the crimes of national socialism. And I never even hinted that in my book. So I think that criticism by Evans was shortsighted. I wouldn't, I I think he's he's not right about that. Yeah."

And you kind of diminish their capability by saying they were only so good because they took Methamphetamine. I thought that was kind of funny because the wimar doesn't exist anymore.

So I'm not a historian, but I, they undermine the importance of the heroes that make up an army. The Soviet army, the British army, the French army, the, the German army, like these are humans. And some of the great military campaigns involve people really stepping up now, like the effectiveness of the military tactics with Blitzkrieg, the effectiveness of meth, the strategic decisions around where to invade, the timing, the speed, all of those are important. But there's humans there, there's real heroes. And sometimes historians kind of diminish that. I don't know what to make sense of it. I I might be just an idiot. But I've had a great conversation with James Holland. I've gotten to know him well. He kind of analyzed the mistakes made by Hitler and by Stalin and the Operation Barbarosa. But I just, through generations, because I grew up in the Soviet Union, you hear these stories of these heroes. You know, my grandfather was a, was a machine gunner and miraculously survived. And like I just knowing those stories, Stalingrad would not have happened without the heroes on the Soviet side. And it's easy to say, there's a lot of blunders, a lot of bad tactics, all this kind of stuff. But to me, from the human side, I just know through my bloodline, the people that have fearlessly given their life to defend their homeland. And that sometimes could be a little bit easily dismissed. So I don't know what to make sense of it. Maybe I'm romanticizing or I'm, maybe I'm speaking to the suffering that the people have felt and they just propagate themselves through my, my life story. And then maybe the gratitude I have for the people who have stopped the, the Nazi forces."

          "value": "2 (82m 16s):\nI would say so, yes. I'm not an expert on the Wimar. This is a very complex, large organization. But I see most of the officers of the Wimar as not necessarily Nazis in the way that they would, you know, shout hail Hitler all the time. They were highly intelligent, highly trained, super professionals that ran a very effective war machine. And at one point, more and more of these generals realized that the orders that Hitler were given were not really helping, you know, and they have their men dying because of it. So that creates a lot of tension. And that, that led to the mistake that Hitler did in Dunkirk, basically what Churchill called the cut, which was the idea to storm through the Aden mountains and kind of cut off the British and French troops who were still, you know, in the north of Belgium trying to figure out what was going on. Suddenly the Germans are behind them so that they, they kind of cut as a, like a sickle into enemy territory. The sickle cut that was so successful that basically the campaign was won already. So then the Germans invaded, like occupied all the cities on the, on the canal back to England to kind of cut off the British completely. So they couldn't, you know, even flee. But there was just, Dunkirk was open the last port that was open and the German army was like, you know, they were already on the outskirts of Dunkirk. They could have just taken it and closed that, you know, that hole for, for the British military to get out. But Hitler then did his famous, and this is all the dynamic of the Western campaign, you know, a lot of things happen every day. And then they're saying like, we are gonna have Dunkirk tomorrow, and then it's over, and then Hitler stops the tanks. It's this famous Hal feel, the the order to stop. And, you know, they were all on meth, you know, they didn't wanna stop. But Hitler was not on meth. Hitler was, he was, he, he basically, it was a, a little bit similar than than Berlin Munich thing. Hitler didn't really understand that campaign. It was too fast for him. He, because they didn't say like, oh, they're all on meth, they're not gonna sleep. They're Go to, they're gonna behave radically. They didn't discuss this, they discussed this in the old fashioned terms. And Hitler was seeing like, they do not protect their flanks. What if the British come from the north? This is terrible. Like militarily. It was a, they were already fighting World War ii, while Hitler was still fighting World War I and especially the allies. They were still fighting World War I, but the tank generals on meth or the tank generals without meth, the tank generals per se, they were fighting a new type of war. And Hitler then got a visit from ing the head of the Air Force, the luft, wha and Goring was a morphous that was, that is very well documented. Like he was on morphine. He was high as a kite most of the time. And that comes with losing touch with reality, I would say. Or at least it, it changes your grip on reality. You know, maybe you're still a good decision maker, but it could lead to, you know, if you're intoxicated, let's say you are writing and you're intoxicated, you think it's great, but the next day you read it as shit, you know. So ing was using morphine in the morning, then met Matt Hitler at the Phe Nest, which was Hitler's headquarters to, to command the Western campaign. The Fel Nest. And Girling said to him, if the Army generals are now gonna take Dunkirk, then basically the Army has won this campaign and that will give Army high command, which is already against you. Because they were, you know, for them Hitler was always like the dec like the small kind of regular army guy, because that's what Hitler had been in, in, in the, in First World War. And now suddenly he was the big decision maker. So they never, they thought they make much better decisions than him. So go says their power will be so overwhelming that they will for now on call the shots how this war will continue and what will be done next. You should let me with the do the job from the air, the National socialist LUT is gonna end the western campaign. So he thought that he could destroy, it doesn't make sense, you know, even destroy the British military from mo planes. Maybe you can do it, but certainly he couldn't do it. So the, the tank generals received the halil, the whole, the stopping order. They didn't believe it when they received it, because the victory, this would've been complete victory over Great Britain. This would've been the end of Great Britain. The whole British military was encircled, but they did get out through Dunkirk. That's why the movie Dunkirk by Christopher Nolan is not good. 'cause he doesn't describe what happened on the German side. It's just this heroic British thing. Yeah, we just got out and we reformed and then we beat, you know, the, this was just because Hitler was afraid of the power of, of his, of Army high command and convinced by Ings morphine high vision that he would stop it with, with the Air Force. Which he couldn't, which he couldn't. I mean, he bombed. And then the British, you know, they weren't ships and a few ships were sunk. But basically they got, they got out. You need to do this on the ground, at least back then, you would've needed to do it on the ground. So that was the, a big mistake by Hitler. That's why Fon Marstein, one of the three tank generals from February 17th was Ramel, Fon, Marstein and Gutian. And from Einstein le he later said he spoke of a azi, a lost victory. He said the Western campaign was a lost victory because we really could have achieved the victory. We could have dominated, you know, British, they could have, you know, invaded Britain. There was no more military Well,"

One of the big mistakes is the invasion of Britain. So you already mentioned the mistake with Dungar, but beyond that, if they even captured mainland Europe, the, they could have just neutralized the British threat and not invaded Britain, and then go after the oil, which is much needed maybe in the Middle East. So focus on that campaign before invading the Soviet Union, and then maybe wait for the Soviet Union to invade them through Poland, which would be likely coming or wait until 1943, something like this, to invade east without the western front having to be been there. And the, the other really big mistake is, is declaring war against the United States having complete disrespect for the United States and, and, and declaring the United States, which would didn't have to be done at all. Right? So it's collecting enemies when those didn't have to be done. So there is, to me, actually, there's a lot of paths there. As dark as it, it is to imagine for Nazi Germany to be successful in the invasion and the Soviet Union even."

'cause opium is a natural drug, but there's something in the opium that actually is decisive and that's morphine. So he was able to extract that from the opium. So he basically, this young guy, he invented morphine, which then became, you know, very important in wars. Especially like the American Civil War is unthinkable without morphine, or at least it would've been very different because with morphine you can treat people, you can amputate people, you can fix people up. So, and, and send them back into battle. And that, that also corresponded with the development of the hypodermic needle. The injection needle that was around in the mid 19th century. So the injection needle and morphine together became a very efficient way to treat soldiers. And that prolonged, for example, the Civil War in America."

They made oco, which when Germany lost the war, that patent was basically taken by America and then ended up in oxycodone. So if you inject Orco, that was a very popular drug in the twenties, because apparently it gives you the most beautiful high on earth. You're like super high. Like you feel extremely well and you can think very clearly and you feel like this is how he, this is how life should feel on high on Koal. This is like Klaussmann, the son of Thomas man, he used Koal. Quite a few doctors actually used it also. And probably quite a few Jewish doctors also used it because this was like a doctor's drug. Doctors knew how to, you know, set the, the injection. And it was, you know, a great experience. And Hitler, he really loved to be on Kool. Like he would use Kool every second day in the beginning, 10 milligrams intravenously. Then he raised to 20 milligrams. And I spoke to someone who's actually done exactly that drug application because I wanted to know how Hitler felt. And I didn't feel like doing it myself for some reason I was, I don't like needles, so I didn't wanna put a needle in my vein to have like the Hitler drug experience. I should have done it like a historian, a proper historian never does that. Okay. So I take, I I, but I thought I should take quite a few drugs that I write about to understand it better. But this drug, I didn't take, I didn't, I never shot oxycodone intravenously into my veins. But I, I met someone who did, and he said it's, it's like the, it's like the king's high, you know, if you do that properly, obviously you get addicted to it, you know,"

But when people looked at him after he had given them an injection and they said thank you and I feel so great now, that's what kind of made his day, you know. So one day a man entered his doctor's office on Fus Andum named Hubertus Hoffman. And Hubert Hubertus Hoffman was a photographer and he had gonorrhea. And because he knew about alternative ways to treat, he actually cured him. And Hubertus Hoffman said to Morrell, I have a good friend and I think you should meet him and I'm gonna have a dinner in Munich and I think it would be really worth your time to come. And Morrell came and the good friend was Hitler because Betos Hoffman was the photographer of Hitler and they were in German. We have a you a formal you, which is Z. Like if I don't even know you so well, I say Z. And if you're my close friend, I say, do you and Hitler only had like four people, he would say you to, he would always like to see like the distance. It was always about distance and respect and borders and boundaries. What"

So he had a dinner with just him, Hitler, Ava Brown, Hitler's girlfriend. And Morel came like, they sent a plane to Berlin to pick him up. So it was like VIP treatment. It was the whole thing. And this is 36? 36. Yeah. They had spaghetti with tomato sauce on the side. I read in the, it's like a description of this event. The tomato sauce was on the side and there was moscar. What is moscar? It's a, it's a spice. Nutmeg. Nutmeg. Yeah. It was a nutmeg, which is an unusual recipe I guess, but that's what they had. And spaghetti wasn't a fancy thing, you know, it came from Italy, from Mussolini, the, the who invented fascism in Italy and who was like Hitler's role model for a long time until Hitler surpassed him, obviously. So the spaghetti, the spaghetti that came from Italy and it was like a big thing. And Morel had the big problem that spaghetti's hard to eat, right? And he couldn't even, like, it was a catastrophe. But he got out of it because Hitler complained about stomach problems. 'cause Hitler was a terrible vegetarian. He was a so-called cake vegetarian. He would only eat like sweets, like cake, no meat of course. But like, he wouldn't like eat healthy stuff, you know. So he, he was bloated the whole time because we only eat like cake and white bread and it's not good. So he voiced that. And there was also brunt was there like his, an official doctor from the, from the, from the As that was like his doctor. And, and Hitler said, my doctors can't cure me. And more was like, this is my chance. Thank, thank you God. And he told Hitler about the probiotics, which Hitler had never heard of and like also broadened the doctor he hadn't heard of because that was a new thing that you give. And he, Hitler was asking, what is that? And Morel said, these are live bacteria from like German soldiers from the war in the first world war that were fighting in Serbia. There was one guy who didn't get the stomach flu and all the others like drank the water in Serbia. And he all got sick. But this one guy, so his bacteria, and this is a true story, his gut bacteria were cultivated into a medicine called Muta Flo. And Morre told Hitler about this. And he said, this is amazing. Like I have to try this, you know, and it helped, you know, he got the Muta Flo, he did the muta flo kind of therapy and it cured him. He suddenly had no bloating anymore. And the farting of Hitler was really bad, so bad that he, it would like, he like const, like it diminished his, you know, ability to work, you know, so suddenly he could work. So he felt bad. He didn't have the pain. He felt great. So he really thought that is a wonder doctor. And he asked pretty quickly afterwards, do you wanna be my personal physician? And was like his, his wife was very much against it because she said, if you become the personal physician of Hitler, you won't have any time for me anymore. And he said like, come on man, this is like the chance you only get once in your life."

He just think it's great, you know, I'm gonna be the doctor, I'm gonna be part of history. So he becomes the personal physician. And being this vitamin guy, like vitamins were really his thing. Like he believed in the power of vitamins. And today I think we know that he was right, vitamins are good, but back then no one knew. And Hitler was like, okay, he told Hitler and then Hitler said, okay, I wanna try this vitamins. And, and what they did from the beginning was injections. 'cause Hitler didn't want to take a pill. 'cause a pill takes too long. And it goes through the, the track that he has the problems with, like the digestion. Like he didn't want to take a pill. He believed in the injection and more was the masterful injector. So more because the needles were thicker than they are today, but more could give you an injection without you feeling any pain. So Hitler was quite impressed. So he got like a vitamin C injection, but Hitler loved the daily injection. So he got hooked on the daily injection. Once he got the injection, the day was good. And he never got sick, actually. Like, and he could stand like for a long time with the arm raised, he did like, he, he went to the gym basically. I mean he had a gym where he, he was like doing exercise so he could have the, the arm up for like hours when a military parade would walk by. So he was quite fit and he was never sick and Morga was not giving him the daily injection. And they, they lived happily ever after basically until the Soviet Union attack. Wait, wait."

          "value": "2 (109m 5s):\nThis was a day in August of 1941. Germany had invaded the Soviet Union on June 22nd. So this is about six weeks into the campaign, which was called, and Germany was doing pretty well. And it came to a crucial moment where high command said, now we're gonna take Moscow. And Hitler said, no, we're gonna split up the troops and take line guard, which is now St. Petersburg in the north and in the south. We're gonna go for the, for the oil fields. Basically. That was his plan. He said, let's not do Moscow. And High Command was like, this is the biggest mistake we must take Moscow. If we, if we take Moscow, we're gonna win. And Hitler became ill for the first time on the day. This decision or that, I mean this is a dynamic thing that's going on. You know, the, they're moving and now they have to decide, will we split up or we'll continue towards Moscow. And he had the Russian flu in German, which is a, like a flu type disease with very high fever. It comes like they were in the field, like, so they were in the east, you know, camping out. Maybe he drank water that wasn't good or he had some, you know, they tested everything meticulously. But he got, you know, he got sick, high fever. He felt like shit. And he said to Morrell, and you know, you can see that in Morell's notes. Like Morrell describes this very vividly in his, in his notes, which are at the federal archives, which no historian ever, ever looked at except me. The non historian, which is kind of funny. So he describes how Hitler then asks of him, basically says vitamins are not enough anymore. Like he's very weak. He must must Go to the military briefing. But if you, the flu is quite a heav severe disease. I think if you have a heavy flu, you really feel like you're gonna die. You can't Go to a military briefing. But Maurice kind of fought with himself and then he decided to inject an opioid into Hitler veins intravenously, like the strongest application possible. And this was Dolan, which is a German opioid that was legal. And I was once an exchange student in Flint, Michigan, 1988. And I was number one of the tennis team 'cause I was quite a good tennis player. Nice. We were playing our main enemy. I think it, I was at Flint Powers Catholic High School in Flint, Michigan, and I think it was Power Central. And they had a number one Mark Steiner still remember. Wow. He was feared and no one, no one could beat him. Yes. And on the day of the match, I had the Russian flu, basically. I was, and I was the hope, I was the number one, the wonder kid from Germany. And they took me to a doctor and the doctor gave me an injection. And I don't know until this day because I just, I, I was, you know, kid, I got the injection. I was 17 and I felt great. Like the flu was gone like this. It was probably an opioid, something, you know, something that just shuts off all the pain and gives you, you know, energy. And I beat this guy in a way. I totally, I I thought of a new technique by playing like very high balls, like in the, in the, in the direct like fearful competition I would've lost. So I played something that in Germany we call footin, which is something you don't really do. You just play high"

He decides, you know, in front of everybody. No one is able to, no one overpowers him in that meeting. He was very good in the room. And the d the troops are split up like leading God is now a target. This weakens the general thrust towards Moscow. This is probably why they didn't take Moscow. They probably could have taken it or maybe not, you know, but they, that's the decision was made in August to,"

So Right. The whole point was they can move really fast. They, they, and they, not just fast, but they can move on all terrain. So they can go around, you know, if wars were fought on normal roads, you were supposed to travel a certain kind of way. If you go fast and around, not on paths that are usually taking attack from all kinds of sides. That's why you can conquer as much as Jeniss Con was able to conquer. And the same thing with the, with the Nazi forces, this is their biggest advantage. And the not using that is, is, is is essentially the end of its effectiveness."

Well, not immediately, like you can see when you study his medications, that that is a turning point in a way that now he, he deviates from the vitamins, like he becomes more interested in what's out there. And like from 41 to 43, he tries out a lot of medications that he didn't try out before. Before that it was quite conventional, mostly vitamins and glucose. But now he becomes experimental and he discusses this with more, and morale is also very ex experimental. Like they got really, they really nerded themselves into like, what can we use like bulls, testicle extracts. So morre, in order to present those things to his patient, a he created a pharmaceutical company that he ran. He was so, he was a personal physician of Hitler. And he was also the CEO of Hamma Pharmaceuticals, which had its production site in occupied Czechoslovakia. And for example, at one point when Germany had invaded the Ukraine, Morre asked for a monopoly for all the organs of all the slaughtered animals from all the slaughterhouses in the Ukraine. So this was a huge logistical operation. Like all the slaughtered animals, all the organs were removed for the personal physician of the sent in military trains back to the, to the factory in, in occupy Czechoslovakia. And like the, the military became really upset with that because they said, we need our trains to transport back our wounded soldiers now we're like, cars are full with like awful and pig's hearts and pigs and, and livers. And it was totally bizarre. And, but morale then became like, he was this like good natured Dr. Feel good in the beginning. And then when the Ukraine was occupied, he became this like business freak who like made a lot of money with his dubious hormonal concoctions, where like he would threaten the army. If you don't let the train with my raw materials Go to my factory, I will tell Hitler and you will have a problem. He was up, he was acting like that. He, he became quite an asshole actually, and the war criminal because he also at his factory where he would make the famous pick liver extract that was then tested by Hitler. Hitler said it was, that's a, that's a good medication. I feel more, I have more energy. So this can also be sold to the German military. That's how it worked because the regulations at the time were that it was very difficult to bring out a new medication onto the market 'cause medications to bring them onto the market. You need certain test phases and all of that stuff. So that's hard to do in a war, in a war, especially in, in World War ii. So Hitler said to more, I'm gonna be your Guinea pig, you just make it in your factory. I test it and if I think it's good, then I'm just gonna write a, today you would say like a decree, you know, because I'm the president, you know, I can like order it that it's gonna be legal all over Germany.

You know, this is something that makes you function. Maybe he signed, I mean it went over his desk, the stimulant decree, but I don't know if he really read it or understood it. I mean he probably knew Pavi team 'cause everyone knew it. And maybe, you know, they discussed it, but they would probably also not, I mean there, they, there's a point when there's a conflict about Methamphetamine in the Army. This is when the secretary of health of the German government, the Nazi government Conti, he starts riding to the army and he says, you must stop this. This is against Nazi ideology. But the army basically doesn't listen to him and keeps on using meth all the way to the end. So maybe that guy Conti, maybe he discussed this with Hitler, but also Hitler never, you know, if Hitler would've said we stopped the Methamphetamine, it probably would've stopped. But Conti saying that wasn't, wasn't enough. I don't think Hitler was really into meth. It was not his thing. He was more into the opioids, into these weird hormonal things. Like those things were, especially the opioids were interesting to him because you can function on opioids for a long time if you have a proper product. And a doctor that gives you the injections. I mean, ING was high on, was addicted to morphine from 1923 until when the Americans captured him in 45, that's 22 years. He was functioning on morphine. And when they captured him, he had, I write about it in Blitzed, like the amount of morphine capsules he had on him. So what the Americans did was first take away all the morphine from him, and then he went through withdrawal in American, you know, incarceration. And he lost, you know, a lot of pounds. And he became like a more of a haggard girling, which was then in Nurnberg, you know, this haggard kind of guy defending what he did. And so Hitler was really an, Hitler was really an opioid guy while the army was really methed up. That's, that's how he could sum it up briefly. He"

          "value": "2 (128m 32s):\nProbably, yeah. I mean it's very weird that it didn't succeed. 'cause he had the bomb, he put it next to Hitler. He took out some of the explosives before he went into the room. This is one of the big mysteries. Why did Berg take out some of the explosives? There's no explanation for it, but Hitler survived. But he was quite injured, which Nazi propaganda always denied. Like they always said the hit the, the fuel was miraculously unharmed. But he was quite harmed. There were like over a hundred splinters from the wood everywhere. His eardrums were blown, which, you know, it's quite an injury I guess, you know, he was bleeding internally and he was shell-shocked basically. And then a new doctor comes in, his name is Ing, because Morre was not a, in Germany we have, well, I guess it's worldwide. It's the ear, nose and throat specialist. Right? So an ear, nose and throat specialist from the German army called Dr. Ging. He was ordered to come into headquarters after the bomb attack to treat Hitler's blown ear drums. And ging gave Hitler Cocaine because Cocaine at the time was being was, you know, it was used, it was not schedule one, you know, it was, it had the effect that it would numb the pain and you could, you could like use it, you would like put it on a certain place where you had the pain and then it would numb that area. But Hitler was like, he, he'd never taken Cocaine before, but he got very interested in it. And Ging writes a meticulous report about his experiences with Hitler alone. That report is, is really fun to read. It's about a 15 page report that he did for American military after the war when he was being interrogated by American military. He like described what happened with Hitler and him, and he realized that Hitler really liked the Cocaine. And then he like started saying, now give it in the nose. Now I, and then it was a, a liquid that he could apply like with a dab like into the nose. Like it wasn't Cocaine powder, but he could like it was liquified. Yeah, interesting. Liquified Cocaine. And Hitler loved it. And he is just saying things like, finally I can think clear again. And it, he had this Cocaine rush, which is a rush of superiority. It's a, it's a dangerous drug because you think you know more than the other. It's not very humble drug, you know, it, it, it, it just increases the ego. And that actually he liked that because that was, you know, after the bomb attack, he, he thought everyone is a traitor. Like he didn't feel safe anymore in his own bunker, you know. And he was like, Nazis. And right wing is always paranoid, like, who's the enemy? Like they're behind us, like they're stabbing us in the back. So Hitler was this type of person. So the Cocaine kind of stabilized him. And Ging realized that this guy is like a drug guy. Like he didn't know. He like came in, he saw the fur for the first time. He is like, he was like in awe and like a drug wreck was approaching him. And as soon as he had some Cocaine in his system, 'cause this was summer 44, he already had taken a lot of opioids and a lot of drugs. So he, and a lot of these dubious hormonal concoctions, which led to autoimmune diseases in Hitler, maybe even had Parkinson's. He was morale, basically turned him into a physical wreck that Ing also writes about this, like, he's like trembling before he goes into the room for the first time where the fur is. And then like old guy, like in a blue kind of pajama is kind of coming up to him and kind of shaking his hand. That's the fur, you know? And it gives him, he's like totally shocked because he's like, you know, the, the, the destiny of the German nation, the whole Europe, everything is like, yeah, hangs on this guy, you know? And then whenever he takes Cocaine, he's a little bit better. Like, but the Cocaine had the problem that Gissing was more of a, at least later in his discussions with the US military, he described himself as a conscientious guy. And he is like, I became, like, I had the kind of promises giving Hitler more Cocaine. And yeah, I mean, and I'm sure Hitler could have sensed that. And then Morre started disliking gissing because Hitler spent more time now with gazing than with him. And there was a, what I call the doctor's war ensued 'cause gazing then tried to get rid of Morre because ging could suddenly see that Hitler was receiving a lot of drugs and he was taking Cocaine with ging. Ging left the room, then Morrell would come in and give him Kool, the opioid intravenously, which is the speed ball effect. Cocaine and an opioid, you know, at the same time. That's like, that creates a really crazy high, but that's a high, that's not stable anymore. You know, that's a, that's a high that you, that's like at, at the end of your drug career, you take the speedball."

And then the, the, the doctors really fought for influence over Hitler and Ging teamed up with Himler, head of the Ss and basically said to Himler, this Morere guy. And Himler was already suspicious of Morre, obviously, because Morrell is spending so much time with Hitler, there's no control. Like Himler was a control freak.

Maybe he wanted to have the job himself. He certainly tried to get rid of more. And it came to like the high, a high noon situation like the dual between the two doctors. It's by the way, why I think it's completely insane that Hollywood hasn't bought the rights yet, alone. This doctors war,"

          "value": "2 (137m 12s):\nWell, an interesting event is July, 1943 in a villa in northern Italy where Hitler meets Mussolini. And Mussolini is basically fed up with the war, and he wants Italy to leave the axis of evil. And Hitler is really pissed when he hears that. He knows that's what the meeting is all about. And Mussolini, I mean, the Italians invented that modern type of fascism and they were all, Italy was the role model for Nazi Germany. But by now, Nazi Germany of course has been much more powerful. But, you know, Italy is the most important ally. And now Mussolini is like quitting in the middle of the war. I mean, what is going on here? So Hitler becomes, and Morell writes about this quite a lot. He's in a terrible mood. He really, he doesn't want to go, like he might lose his, you know, temper or whatever. He's not happy. And that's actually, that's the day when he receives the Kodi for the first time. And he, 'cause he says to Mo, I'm under such stress, I'm not gonna go. He threatens, like, he calls off the whole thing, like the plane's already waiting in, in Salzberg, everything is ready. And he says, I'm not meeting this guy. And then Mor gives him Ko and you can see, you know, the, the time when he gets the oco and that's when he has this effect for the first time. This like, I, I can do anything. This is great. I'm gonna, I'm gonna explain to Mussolini that he is not gonna leave the war effort. And on the way to the plane, he says to Morrell that this Koal is really helping him and he wants another shot and he receives another shot. So he, he has, he has quite a lot of koal in him when he speaks to Mussolini. And there's like The people who take, who write the protocol of the meeting and also other people around. It's not like, it's not just two people in the room. It's like, I don't know, 15 or 20 people in the room. And a lot of people talk about that meeting in the memoirs and Mussolini is not able to say one word basically because Hitler is so high and so charged. And he's like just telling him the whole time how great this is, you know, what they're doing right now. And of course there's not even, even a, it's not possible that you're gonna leave, you know, we are in this together from the, you know, he explains everything, you know, the whole thing for like two hours. And Mussolini just like, it's like then a, a messenger comes in and says, Rome has just been bombed. He's like, he's like, he knows he can't say anything and he stays, you know. So that was very much influenced that meeting by his koal. And that's probably 'cause he was so successful in Hitler eyes. What happened is why Koal became a very attractive drug for him. And this happened, this was the first time in July, 1943. And then, so he didn't take Kool through the whole time, you know, it only started in July 43. He started with the, with the regular opioid use. You can see that he takes it more and more regular. Now, not every day, but sometimes, like there's a, the September, 1944, he takes Kool every second day, which like junkie rhythm. You take it, then the next day you don't take it, then you take it again."

Yeah. And they wanted to eliminate Hitler in the operation Valkyrie. Not because they thought he's an evil guy, he is killing the Jews, or you know, they wanted to eliminate him because he was not this effective decision maker anymore. That they needed to win the war or to end it in a different way. And I spoke with Anthony Beaver once about the attempt of British intelligence to assassinate Hitler. And he had seen some evidence that at a point in time they dropped those plans because they knew that drugged Hitler or malfunctioning Hitler, which he was after, you know, the summer of 1943, it is better for Britain than, you know, killing Hitler. And then having to deal with like some kind of, you know, maybe the army would've taken over the country and that that would've been more uncomfortable for Great Britain than having this, having the continuation of the degenerating maniac."

          "value": "2 (147m 14s):\nQuite well documented because people at the time were keeping diaries and writing about it. Writing, writing about the experiences also more wrote quite a bit what happened in the bunker. One thing that changed was that O Cordal was not available anymore. So the drug that Hitler actually had become physically addicted to was suddenly not available anymore. This had to do with the bombardment of the Merck Company, the factory in December, 1944. British bombers destroyed the production facilities is and more, there's a report of more the overweight person riding on a motorcycle through bombed out Berlin from pharmacy to pharmacy, basically going into the pharmacy trying to score Koal. And he couldn't find it anymore. It was nowhere to be found. And that's when Hitler goes into withdrawal. What I find surprising is that he didn't use another opioid because morphine was available all the way till the end. But he never kind of made that switch then. Like he doesn't also, he didn't realize for a long time that he becomes physically dependent on a, a drug that he becomes a drug addict. But this realization happens in the last weeks in the bunker. 'cause Bels, he understood it and Gobel wanted that bedroom, the second bedroom. So he said to Hitler, do you understand what's going on that morale makes, turns you into a drug addict? And he does like, and at one point he realized what Gobel is saying is true because he felt the withdrawal, he was shaking and he felt like shit. And, and Morgan is like giving him weird stuff in the end, like one time he gives him Harmine, which is an MAO inhibitor, which is part of Ayahuasca actually, because he still had that in his doctor's bag. It hadn't been used yet. So it gives him that, which also creates some kind of a weird high, but you know, Hitler at one point realizes really what's going on. This is late April, so very late in the game. And there's a few reports of what actually happens. Like some say that Morere has to kneel in front of him and that Hitler puts a gun on his head and says, you've been making me addicted to opioids. Get the hell out of the bunker for sure. He fires him that day. And the Morere described as being in tears, like leaving the bunker. He gets one of the last planes out of Berlin. He has a research lab in the south of Bavaria, close to the back hoof. And he makes like the one of the last, or the last plane out of Berlin. He survives. Yeah. And he goes to this research lab and this is like May 2nd, 1945. He has like a little apartment and his research lab, his wife is still in Berlin. He's like all alone and he starts doing his taxes. And that kind of shows you that he was probably insane at that point, you know, just totally out of touch. Why would you do your tax? Maybe he was bored, you know, maybe it's like he, he didn't do his taxes for so long because he always had to treat Hitler. And then he thinks like, no, what am I gonna do? You know, I'm just gonna do my tax. At least I'm gonna do my taxes now. Very German thing to do. This is just a strange character. I mean you tell this, this hilarious, I would put that in the movie for sure. Him doing his taxes. That's how the movie ends. Well then the Americans move into Bavaria, liberate Bavaria from national socialism, which was a great job they did there. And so I'm also thankful not only to the Red Army, but also to the American forces. Really very thankful that they, because National Socialist was hard to beat. It was a beast, you know, it was hard to beat. So they capture morere and they interrogate him. And he actually lives for another two years in American custody in Germany, in a military prison. And after these two years, his health's really bad, he has heart problems. And the Americans dump him in front of the Munich train station in a much too small kind of uniform jacket, like probably an American uniform. And he's like lying on the pavement in front of the train station. And a half Jewish nurse walks around there, finds him and he says, I'm Teo Mo. It is like, is really like in a movie. I'm Teo I was the personal physician of the fur. She's like, this is 1947, Germany's in ruins. Yeah. And she brings him to a hospital. His wife comes from Berlin for the last time they meet in the hospital at Ganzi, beautiful lake in Bavaria. And then he dies. So that was the end of Morel. So we know pretty much what happens in the end."

And Hitler was often of course in the field in the headquarters, but hit came as much as he could to the Bakov because it's quite beautiful. I went up there, it's quite interesting. And she also had a good relationship with Morrell and there's like a paper that I found where like they were very intimate and very close. Like there's a paper of where she comes to him in the morning and she's, she has like scratch marks. So apparently they had violent sex. So like al also kind of witness to that, that that, that I found in Washington DC in the national Parkhead"

But Eva Brown is an interesting character because she had more of a say than historians for a long time attributed to her than a biography was written on her by a female German historian. And that's a very good biography. It really shows that she had, you know, quite a lot to say in this relationship. She was not the dumb blonde that just, she was quite, you know, opinionated and, and active. So it's, it's, and she was, she was filming him a lot. Like she had, she was always filming in the back of, you can go online and look at the Ava Brown clips and you will see Hitler and Kala at the back of how he's like meeting children, patting their head. And you know, this this, she was contributing to the myth of this private, the private man, the good private man. So Eva Barnes is, is an interesting character for sure. But I found one note that she, in the beginning when Morl started with his drugs, said to Morrell that she wants the same drugs, the same medications, not drugs, the same medications as Hitler. So she would be on one, the same wavelengths with him. She wanted to be, she didn't wanna lose this world, but I mean Hitler became such a drug poly, toxic manic user that of course Ava couldn't keep up with that. They weren't a drug couple. I don't, I didn't see any evidence for that, that they would like take all the crazy drugs together and then have crazy sex or something like that. That's not, that's not how it was. So I think she was sympathetic to Morrell in the beginning and then changed her opinion. And I'm pretty sure she talked with Hitler about it, but there's no records about their private conversations."

But still I found this letter, I don't know why I can't, I can't remember how exactly it happened that I was suddenly reading this letter. And it was the last letter that he wrote in his life. He wrote it to his father and he said that everything I have done, I'm totally fine with it. And I know it's very hard for you and I really am mostly sad for you and mother and my brother that you have to go through this. And I'm very sorry, but I'm fine with it.

And they were, they were like from all flights of life. Like there were, some were artists, other were workers, some were leftists, other were patriots. How always believed that people could come to an agreement, like it's possible to actually talk about things. And he was a, he was a true Democrat, maybe you could say, or a true, I don't know, libertarian or, you know, he was a, he had to learn a hard lesson that with Nazis you cannot argue. 'cause they, they are always right. They're not, they, they, it, it, it doesn't work. At least it didn't work during the third Reich. Like he could, he had, he had published a newspaper during the Weimar Republic called Gina, which means opponent. And in the Gina opponents could all write like who would be on the streets, opponents, they could all write in the, in the opponent. And so it was a, you read all kinds of texts and, and and, and opinions. And he thought when Hitler took over power in 33, that he could continue to publish the opponent. Because the opponent, he, he thought even, you know, in a, in a Nazi at Germany, you know, this keeps the discourse. You have to have a discourse. You have, we have to discuss, we have to disagree, you know. And then in, in April, 1933, two months after Hitler took power, they had a, a meeting with, with the editorial staff and they discussed the new issue. And then there was a knock on the door and it was DSS and they beat up everybody and they destroyed the typewriters and the printing press that they had in the office in Berlin. And they took Haro and his best friend, who was half Jewish to one of these early concentration camps. And they tortured both of them. And the, the Jew was killed. He didn't make it. Henry Langa and Haro at that moment, he realized who he's against, you know, that he has to, he decided to become, to, to fight the system. And the way he fought the system was later during the sixties, we also had a sixties kind of cultural and political changes in Germany. And then our, our sixties, they, they called it March through the institutions. That is a way to infiltrate the system, like to become part of the system and then, you know, change the system from within. So you don't leave the country, you stay, you go into the institutions, you march through the institutions. So Howell decided to go into the Luft va and he was working in the Air Force, Luft VA ministry, a huge building still intact today in Berlin vi quite an interesting building that was like the power center of the Luft for like one of the most important structures in the whole Nazi regime. And he was working there and he worked his way up and he received quite a lot of information. For example, when Germany, for the first time became militarily active again, this was in 1936 when the Germans supported the fascists in Spain in the Spanish civil War. This was a clandestine operation. The Luft did this. And they, like German soldiers went to Spain, like in plain cloth, like to like posing as vacationers. But then they, you know, were actually soldiers in supporting Francos, you know, were a part of Franco's victory later on. And Harrow had this information and he passed, he tried to pass this on to the BBC. He failed by passing it on. Well he, he met a BBC journalist during the Olympic games in, in, in Berlin and told him about this. And the BBC guy was too afraid to make this public. And he kind of buried that information. So how it's, it's, it's just a very interesting character. And he was in love with Libertas and Libertas with him. Howell came from like a bourgeois family, very educated. His great-grand uncle was Frontier Pits, built up the Marine, the Navy for the Kaiser. So he came from this like influential German family. But they were all Patriots. They were not Nazis, they were Democrats, Patriots and Militarists, I, I guess you could say, or like, you know, very straight laced also in a way. And, and Libertas, she came from a castle north of Berlin. She was this like bohemian, like aristocratic bohemian type, very good looking, always playing music. And they'd fell in love. They met on the, on boats. They were both on a, on how was rowing. And she was on a sailboat of a guy that Howell also knew. So he was rowing and he saw the, his friend on the sailboat and he looked at Libertas, she looked at him and they were in love in 1934. And the, the other guy, the friend of Howell, he left his sailboat. 'cause he realized, I'm like that the, the fifth wheel on the car, like not really needed, right? Like, how do you say that in a sailboat terms? I don't know. The third, third sail, it's not needed, you know. But what happened at night, how didn't sleep with Libertas? For her, that was very unusual because everyone wanted to sleep with her. But how like he wanted to keep his clothes on. It was a very warm night. And I researched this quite thoroughly. Like I know exactly the temperature. And so also The Bohemians, when you read The Bohemians, you really experience the life of these people, what, like, what they experience. But everything is, nothing is invented, which is very tricky to do. So what happens that night, like Libertas wants to take off his clothes and he doesn't wanna take them off because why from the torture in April, 1933, he has quite a lot of scars. They even burned swastikas into his thighs. Like not burned, sorry, they with knives. Yeah, the SS So he doesn't wanna show that to her. He just, and he hadn't had a girlfriend for a while. Like he can't open up emotionally because he's fighting the Nazi. It's very secret. Like no one knows about this, that he's long-term planning his life to fight the system that he hates so much because they killed his best friend in front of his eyes. But at one point Libertas does, you know, take off his clothes and she sees this and she's like naive, she's even a member of the Nazi party, but she's not a very active party member. She's just, you know, she works for MGM actually in Berlin, marry a Hollywood film studio office in Berlin. Germany was one of the biggest movie markets. And she was the press girl. She did the campaigns for the big Hollywood movies in Germany. So"

That was always a problem because for her it was weird that someone was against the system, but Hal told, Hal was totally convinced that fascism is wrong and that he has to fight it. And more and more liberties was convinced and then more friends kind of came into the group. And the way how organized this resistance group was through parties, like, they were like a power couple of Berlin and they had a, a great loft apartment. They moved together to a, to a loft apartment on also a side street from Kuda, a huge room. And there they had parties every second Thursday night and they would invite friends. And then once they trusted someone personally, then they would spill the beans and say, this is actually not just a party, but they would like test it, that like at the party they would say something critical of the regime and you immediately, you know, either the person jumps on it responds, or like, you know, goes somewhere else, gets a drink at the bar. You know, it's not, not into it. So that was the way of recruiting people. And that was such an efficient way that the Gestapo was not able to understand this group for a long time and not even recognize that there is a group. Because Gestapo was very good at infiltrating, for example, communist resistance groups. 'cause you just had to go in as a Gestapo guy and be a communist. Just say the right words and they would at one point, you know, take you. But with Hago and Libertas it wasn't so easy, you know, they would, IM they would sniff you out, you know,"

We have, we are a resistance group. Like what if like there's jealousy and what like that this could compromise operations. And it did sometimes.

And if you'd made a joke about Hitler and the wrong person heard it like in a restaurant and would rat on you, you would land in a concentration camp. So people were very, very careful also at parties with like how on libertas and she was singing and they were drinking and dancing. And then suddenly the political discussion started. That's, you know, you have to have guts to then actually not leave the party but to stay. 'cause they were risking their lives basically. As soon as they would f be found out, they would be dead. And people don't want to die when they're like in their mid twenties. They were all, they were, they were pretty young. And the, and also Libertas, she would often say like, we can't win. You know, it's why, why are we risking our lives for like, for like what, you know. So one time they did a Kla Bert, like they produced, 'cause one guy had access to a printing press and they produced leaf, like small papers that had glue on one side. And the paper said what the Nazis did. They, they set up a huge exhibition hall, which was called the Soviet Paradise. And this exhibition was in the center of Berlin. I'd never heard about this before. I found this when I researched The Bohemians, and it was the most popular exhibition during the hall of the, of the war, like 2 million people, 2 million Germans saw this. They went into this exhibition and they saw how horrible the Soviet Union is, how horrible communism is to people. So it was a propaganda show. And the group decided to make these leaflets, which didn't say the Soviet paradise, but it said the Nazi paradise torture as as torture, hunger war. How long will it last? And they glued over a thousand of these stickers everywhere in Berlin, in, in May, 1942 at night. And they organized it in a way that they always to a man and a woman would go out and they had like the stickers with them, and then they would pretend to kiss and would like lean on a wall. And then while they were kissing, one would like put the, put the sticker on, then they would move on in the dark. So in the morning of that May, 1942, tens of thousands of Berliners saw that the, the city was like, saw these things. So is does it make a difference? It made one on that day, you know, it was a very dangerous thing to do. And no one was, no one got caught. And in the morning a lot of people saw that there is actually resistance, that there are people who do something against it. So I think they did something. Yeah,"

No, maybe we will be that spark. So yeah, unless I, when I think that there's this possibility, I must try it, you know, that's, that was his conviction. So he would put his life on the line for that possibility. How did they get caught? They were approached by the Soviet Union who wanted to recruit them as spies, and they didn't want to do that. Howell refused the Soviet intelligence. These are documents that were found in the early nineties. One of the sons of, one of the members of that group of Har, a good friend of Harold, one of his sons, went to Moscow to look at the files and he found kind of furious Soviet KGB kind of descriptions of this weird guy, HARO, that doesn't want to be a proper Soviet spy and just says, yes, I'm gonna give you information so you can hurt Hitler, but I'm not gonna play your game. I'm not gonna be one of you. So still they did collaborate with the Soviet Union. They accepted a radio transmitter from the Soviet Union with, with which they were supposed to send military information by via radio to Moscow. And they like struggle with the technology. The Russians give them like a, an apparatus only with like a Russian instruction. And it's like very difficult. They make mistakes, but what actually then gets them caught is the Russians at one point answer and send a message to them through the ether. And, and, and that message is, is coded, but the Nazis intercepted message and are able to decode it. And in the message it gives the clear names of Haro and his address, which is a total like intelligence blunder. Or maybe they just wanted to give them up and, and, and had their revenge because Stalin, Stalin did crazy stuff like that, you know, so they suddenly know that Gestapo knows how Chut the boys and the high ranking officer and the TWA ministry is giving military information to the Soviet Union. And apparently like he's meeting with all kinds of friends. So they started the Gestapo, started observing the group for months. And the group at one point realizes that they've been basically found out and, but then it's already too late. Then they capture quite a few of them and quite a few get trial, military trial and the death penalty and are also being executed and ha Libert are among them. And also that last chapter of their lives is very well documented. And it's actually ends with that letter, you know, that I found in the beginning. That's the last thing that how does, is write that letter"

That's very interesting what happens with Levi Tass because she gets in custody, the Gestapo asks one of their secretaries get through the bride to go in and pose as a friend to Libertas. And Libertas actually falls for it and starts telling that secretary, who pretends to be her friend and kind of helps her with certain things, tells her secrets. And that kind of breaks the neck of the group. It's very, it's very, it's a very tragic ending. So while my books always contain as much humor as possible, that is not a funny story, but it's a very dramatic story. Even though they had a lot of humor, obviously. I mean they, they had parties to recruit people."

Yeah, it is that, that neuroplastic neuroplasticity in our brain that we do not just repeat the conditioned Sets that we, we we ought to repeat, but that we actually dim down the command center in the brain and let other parts of the brain react. Which is the psychedelic experience basically that I think contributes to the, to the evolution of our species. And our species is certainly threatened by extinction. So I think if we somehow care for the human race, then resistance becomes a very immediate and important topic. You know, because you can resist, obviously your brain is yours. You can resist in many ways, you know, by thinking, just by thinking that's actually why I became a writer when I was a teenager. I was very political. I wanted to change the system. I thought, this is not, this is not good. What's happening. This was in the Cold War. Very cons. I dunno if conservative is even the right word, but you know, Ronald Reagan was president. So I thought my writing could change the brainwaves of the readers basically, and therefore have a, a neuroplastic effect on the reader. And just because that is what literature is literature. And I started off as a, as an as a novelist. And that's really literature. It's about what, what do you see right now? How do you describe it? So you do it in ways that when you read it, when you read a good book, you feel good because suddenly you see different things, your brain changes, you become more free. I think if you read good literature, that was always my form of, of resistance. Communist resistance cells would probably say this is nothing, you know, but I think it is resistance and that's a little bit, I think it resembles a little bit what this group did, just living differently, not living, you know, that's why I said in the beginning, Nazis are bad dancers 'cause they like, I think they were good dancers at the parties, you know, and they were like, I think it's dancing can be a form of resistance."

I said, is it also possible to write a world history like about everything basically? And he said, yes, it is possible. It's not easy because you have to understand like a lot, you know, and obviously it'll always be a selection. It's clear, you know, that's why I also think that the historical science is basically a fictional science. I mean, I have a forward, the Blitzed forward basically tells that story, don't take it with a grain of salt. Not only Blitzed, but every historical book. Because we weren't there, you know, that's what Johnny Depp said when the, when the, when the guy said, so you had like a, a mega pint of, of red wine. He just said, were you there? You know? Yeah. The guy wasn't there. So Histor historical sciences is a fiction. Yeah. But you know, it, it's a certain type of fiction and it, it's based on facts. So I'm not inventing anything in stone sapiens, and I'm highly interested in the very early human history. And there are not a lot of sources. So the, the beginning of the book Is more speculative than, for example, the Vietnam War chapter. In the Vietnam War chapter. I'm in Hanoi speaking to Viet Kong generals, asking them, did they supply heroin to the, to the gis, which would di which diminish their fighting capability. That's, you could research that. And that's, that's, that's also a chapter. And by the way, the Vietnam War is not called the Vietnam War in Vietnam. It's called the American War. And also I was like sitting with these Kong generals in Hanoi just like a few weeks ago for researching for stone sapiens. And I said, so did the Viet Kong bring heroin? Because it's, there's, there's never been evidence that it happened this way. And they just looked at me and, and they said, there's no Viet Kong. Like, what are you talking about? You are the Viet Cong. He said, no, this is an American propaganda term where the, we were the North Vietnamese army. We never call ourselves the Viet Cong. So the book is full of surprises, obviously. But the very early beginning of stone sapiens goes back to about 1.5 million years ago when homo erectus, which who, who also has become kind of famous by now, homo electors. It's like the first human that really gets shit done, you know? Yeah."

          "value": "2 (186m 54s):\nYeah, they move. Yeah. And why were they moving? Why were they moving? I mean, then you can examine exactly where they originated, which was, I mean, it's also disputed by now that it's the great RIF valley that o only the most fossils have been found there. But that doesn't mean that they originated there. Maybe they originated in the central African rainforest where fossils disintegrate and only there in the Rift Valley. We still find it. So, but we know for sure that in the Great Rift Valley, there was a plant called cut, which is like a, a plant speed. So they were using that. It's still being used now in these countries in Ethiopia, Yemen, around the Horn of Africa. Cut is, is, is very normal to use. You chew the leaves and it gives you like, it's like an amphetamine. It's a plant amphetamine basically. So homo, you can, there's no proof that they actually used it, but they were living in that area and the plant was there. So you can, you can write about that. So it's interesting because they, they were able to do certain things like they shed the fur. They were the first ones to have to suddenly be naked. And that has the effect that sweat glands produced. Homoerectus could sweat it out. Basically when they, when they, when they were very hot, what animals couldn't do because they had the fur. So an antelope can run faster as a homoerectus, but at a, at like after 10 minutes, the antelope has to like stop, like what's, what dogs do. Like they, the tongue goes out. And humans didn't have to do that because they were sweating. So they could, they developed the jog jogging mode basically. So they were jogging, they were not sprinting to get the animal. They were jogging it. And when the animal couldn't do it had to rest, then the humans would come and hunt it down. So Homo electro was a very, was evolutionary very good. And then later, the one of the species coming out of Homo Actus is homo sapiens and homo sapiens. At one point there were only like about 1,500 people left. There were not a lot of homo sapiens. There was a point in time when there were quite a few of them. And the problem became inbreeding and there was a real danger of extinction. They were vulnerable, you know, they were not on top of the food chain yet. So they had to develop consciousness. Consciousness is what saved what basically saved us from extinction. Without the human consciousness, we wouldn't be here. You know, that is what made us in the end then superior to, to the other animals. So how did this happen? You can kind of trace how they moved. You can trace that they went through the central African rainforest and there's one plant there, which elephants like, and that's iboga. And iboga now is like the hot thing of the psychedelic renaissance. Ieb iboga, iboga. But it's also the oldest drug in the book. Basically they saw that elephants were eating iboga, the root and the leaves, and suddenly we were like walking backwards and we behaving in an unusual way. And then people were also using this, and this was going on over like a hundred thousand years in the rainforest. So you can, you can write a story about that, you know, did, was it maybe a booga? Of course you can't prove it, you know, maybe the frontal cortex grew by itself. You know, that's"

He doesn't want to be personally influenced, but he, he said he will take it at a certain point in time, but right now he's still just working on data, just on with patients, you know, and what he found and also examining in the brain through brain scanners, what actually happens. And like classic psychedelics, like LSD or psilocybin, they dock at certain points, they interact with certain receptors. It's quite well understood how they work. And he said Iboga is completely different. It's like, and he also showed this with his hands because he's just so mesmerized by his own findings. Like it kind of, it's kind of everywhere at the same time in the brain. Like he says, it's like a spa for the neurons, basically. Like the, it's, it's, it's his findings show. And these are academic findings at Columbia that I bo it's like as if he says, he said to me as if I Bogar would know our brain from a long time. Like it knows exactly, like if you're addicted to something or if you're depressed, a depression literally is a depression in the neuronal network. A depression is a thought loop, for example. Or you know, a system of thought loops that you, that I'm not worthy, I'm not whatever. I can't do it. I I you always go back like this is it, it really kind of depresses your brain in a way. And the bogar see this immediately and kind of takes the depression out and, and, and, and, and makes your brain kind basically. Well again, so that this is, this is what he, this is what his findings are. So it's, it seems, he says he's totally convinced, this is like a, he doesn't call it a plan, he calls it like a neuro technology of the 22nd century. So I bogar really seems to be in a different kind of category. That's why I really feel that stone sapiens must be written because there's so much that historians just shied away from. And it all, it all started when I was on the island of Crete, the biggest island of Greece. Crete for, that's another like Hara moment on Crete was the first what is called high culture of Europe, the Minan culture. You might have heard of the Minan culture and no one can explain so far why there on, on Creed suddenly in Europe they started making amazing structures and amazing art. And what, how did it happen there that this like totally backwards place creed became, I mean, backwards is any other place, you know, why did it happen there that such intricate objects were being made and that the culture was, was developing so intensely. And I was kind of thinking about that. That's how the book started. I was with my kids on vacation vacationing creed. And if you Go to like Knossos Oros, the big archeological sites or to the museum and have Cleon, you don't find an answer. Why did it happen there? And then I found like an old book in a, in an old bookshop and it described an excavation site at the sea and that it was like maybe a maritime place where like a harbor basically. And then while I was swimming there, I found on the sea floor the remnants of a wall that was a harbor wall that was out, that was breaking the waves. And then I climbed over the fence because that a archeological site is still fenced off. Like it's not explained officially what it is. And the, the walls in there, the biggest walls of the whole bronze era. And it was actually quite a big harbor. And then the next step is what did they trade? And they traded olive oil because creed was the first place to produce olive oil. And then I also found, and this is historically documented, opium was made in creed and the poppy flower was growing there. And this was the harbor, basically they became incredibly wealthy through olive oil and opium trade through that harbor. So you could say that the whole of the European high culture, which we know goes from Minoa, it goes to Athens. So it all started basically with, with, you know, they were drug dealers in a way or they, I mean it was the most potent medicine 'cause it was the only medicine that that numbs the pain for sure. You know, opium works and the min ones develop that. So I mean it's kind of, it's a bit similar to the Blitzed experience. You, the more I start, I did research, the more I found that"

And if you study them, they're really good, but only the humans are good. Then Neals, they were like worse artists than us. And you can also see there's a fa very famous one that comes from Alger with like a sha and, and around his body, like mushrooms grow out of his body. So he was like a mushroom sha. And so mushrooms seem to have been like part, at least in that area. And that, I mean, that's the stone ape theory that that that Terence McKenna did. And I think I, a lot of evidence kind of points to it that we were able to develop our consciousness in a better way than the Neanderthals who did not have a drug culture. They were basically too sober for the future. They, we assimilated them. They had no chance against our impetus of boldly going where no one has gone before. They were much more like happy with what they had. They were not progressing all the time. Like we have the transcendental kind of moment, which, which is, you know, the psychedelic experience is psychedelic experience. I guess you could think of it without it. But to imagine sapiens makes more sense to imagine sapiens as stone sapiens as as a species that was able to incorporate psychoactive components into his development. It, it, it makes a lot of sense.

          "value": "2 (199m 36s):\nWell, I think Moses is quite interesting. Moses was a traumatized man that had fled Egypt where he had killed a per killed a man who had been beating up a Hebrew. So Moses kind of took revenge and killed him. So he was running from the law and he was together with, in the Bible it says, I think 66 people, they were in the desert in the, in the Sinai and they had been fasting for days and no alcohol. So it was kind of a psychedelic retreat basically. I mean this is being examined by Israeli Israeli scholars. And I think it's very interesting work. Like they examine in detail what does the Bible say? And the Bible mentions in that passage where Moses has, sees the burning bush and then gets the 10 commandments in that bible passage. There's a lot of, several times the acacia is mentioned and the acacia, the, the, the Egyptian acacia grows right in the, in the, in that Sinai area and contains DMT. So there's there, there, there's this Israeli research that Moses was actually having a, a trip basically that he, he was seeing, he had, he was hallucinating. The burning bush was, you know, if you take LSD and you look at a bush in the heat, you know, it, it, it, it'll move, you know, it, it might resemble like a burning and you, you know, experience. And then he went up the mountain, which takes three hours while the other, the others were staying down. And with a DMT type of experience, it's not that everyone in the group has the same experience, similar to ayahuasca sometimes. Like one guy has like incredible experience while another person might not feel that much at all. And Moses felt a lot. And you do feel a lot when you, you know, when you are, when you have something to work through. And he had certainly something to work through the trauma of killing a man. So it's also no surprise that he receives one of the commandments you, you should not kill, you know? So for him it's like extremely, extremely important. And what he receives on the, on the mountain like God is like there's someone speaking to me and he understands that God is not, that there's not many gods just one God. Like he has a revelation, you know? And it, I think when I, when I read, you know, these examinations by these scholars, I think it makes a lot of sense to, to imagine that the Jewish religion comes from Moses trip. And also if you look at the Jewish religion, they're quite open to drugs. I don't know if that, you know, that could be an unconscious reaction to that, to that, to that kind of trippy beginning. Like they have Purim where it's like you're supposed to get intoxicated to get closer to God. They're not as straight laced as the Christians. Like, they would just, you know, they just allow alcohol. It's like the blood of Christ. So also stone sapiens is a book about religion also. The, the, the Islam and intoxication is also a very interesting topic 'cause you have the Sufis who intoxicated themselves to get into ecstasy, to to be closer to God. And then you have like the conservative Islamist scholar iia who defended Damascus against the Mongols by combining anti-drug rhetoric. Like they're bringing drugs to us and they are not good Muslims. So it's it drugs and religion. Sometimes drugs kind of help religion to like are used in religious context. But then you can also see that religions work as prohibitionist movements against drugs like the Christian Church. Also the purity law for example, it's very famous in Germany, it's called the rhe gabo beer can only contain three things, water, hops and barley or something like that's, that's the purity law. And that was done by the church in 16th century and in Germany for a long time this was seen as like, this is like a quality control. Like beer has to be pure, only has these ingredients, but it's actually a move by the church to weed out all the other ingredients that had been put in beer before, like nightshade plants. So beer also witches were brewing crazy beer. You drink it and you have like visions and you dance around the fire. It's like, and the church didn't like this, so the church said this is the beer now. And, and especially the hops was the, was the new ingredient for the beer. And this, so the purity laws is the first prohibitionist law in, in, in, in, in the middle ages in Europe. Another fascinating."

          "value": "2 (204m 44s):\nOne of the very fascinating turning points that I have been able to kind of pinpoint, or at least I think this is what happened, is when do the first kings come up? They weren't kings for a very long time. The first king that I can identify was in the so-called Sumerian high culture was in Ook, was Gilgamesh. And they wrote the Gilgamesh epic about, you know, the Great King. But that was four or 5,000 years ago, something like that. But what happened in the thousands of years before, there's no source that there were rulers. It seems like humans were quite good in organizing themselves without kings before these first kings came. And I mean thousands of years from the end of the ice age until the Sumerian high culture, there were no kings. So people were quite able to organize their communities. There was, for example, al in Eastern Turkey that was working for like 2000 years without any hierarchies. I think that is, that is quite interesting. And then why do suddenly the hierarchy start and what makes the hierarchy stronger? And again, I'm still researching this, but in Sumer we can see that it's the beer that destroys the hierarchy free society. 'cause they suddenly, they are able, I mean, beer is quite old. The first beer was made in Gobekli Tepe, the famous first kind of structure of mankind. I also write about that 'cause it's very interesting, small detail. What is Gobekli Tepe? No one knows. How did they make it? No one knows, but they made it. But why did they make it? I think they made it because they were creating a meeting place. And why was that so important? There were not so many humans at the time. There were like one to 4 million. Those are the estimates on the whole planet. And they were usually living in small communities of like a hundred people up to 500, not more, but in, so the problem then is, again, in breeding, in inbreeding means it's a degeneration. So it's, it's, it's a problem. We, we are genetically not so diverse actually as humans. So, and, but Gobekli tepi people are meeting from different areas, having sex with people they usually wouldn't see creating healthy children. And Quebec Tempe was working for 1,600 years and I think it was like an evolutionary kind of machine. Like without, without that idea, we're gonna create like a fucking place or party place, you know, it was a party basically. They were eating very well. They found a lot of bones, but no one lived there. They just came together there for parties. And then after 800 years, they start making beer there. And then the situation slightly changes. They found these beer, these places where they made beer. You can still find the chemicals and kind of, it's, it's sure that they made beer there. And then once they make beer, they create different stone circles and then somehow it changes. And we, we can see clearly how it changes in the Sumerian high culture when beer, beer then becomes a business, beer become is being done by the, by the priests, by the ruling class or ruling class emerges. Like monasteries often brew beer. And that was also the case in, in, in the Sumerian high culture. They make beer, they, they, they labeled the beer like the, the, the temple that would make the beer. The beer would be attributed to that temple. It would be sold. So that temple kind of rises in status, makes money. So that's how hierarchies started up. So the hierarchy, which is the big problem right now, that we have these hierarchies, that we have these kings everywhere that kind of steal our money or at least make it very difficult for us as humans to organize on an egalitarian planetary scale, which is our only chance for survival. If we at one point overcome the hierarchies, overcome the nation states, and create a planetary, probably AI assisted open source AI assisted planetary society. And everyone has the same political rights. There's no more borders, there's a planetary minimum income. So no one is starving. Everyone has at least what everyone needs, which is totally possible. It's just a what, it's just a problem of organizing and of breaking the resistance of those who don't like that. And there's a lot of resistance obviously. I mean, I'm talking about what's happening on the planet in 50 years, not what's gonna happen tomorrow. But that is where we slowly are moving towards. And you can see that this actually comes from, you know, a, a time when we were able to organize ourselves without kings. We don't, we don't need kings. Kings always say, if you don't have me, then someone else, some other guy will come. And, but you know, it's, it's, it's this. That's why I, I mean that's why I'm not, you know, if a nation state makes war against another nation state, I'm not taking a position and saying this country is like better. Basically the, the both nation states are doing war and who has to suffer is us, you know, is stone sapiens is the human, is the human species."

And that sounds maybe less interesting than it actually is. It's, it's, I mean, I, I find it fascinating. I had tried LSD, I, it was given to me by my girlfriend at the time, Anya in Lower Manhattan on a Saturday night, 1993. So I was like 23. And she said, let's take LSD. And I'd never really taken any drug. Like I maybe smoked a bit of weed, but I didn't know what a strong drug is. And she gave me this paper and I took it and we walked around in the East Village, pre gentrified, east Village. It's pretty cool actually. And it didn't work for like one hour. I felt nothing. And then I went into the toilet, I had a falafel or something, I went into the toilet and there was a mirror, like I was peeing and there, there was this mirror and, but the walls had like lines, like there were painted in lines. Suddenly these lines were started to like vibrate. And that's then the trip started. And it was such an powerful experience that I thought I would go insane. Like it was the worst trip I've ever had. Like, it was 'cause so strong. I was totally scared. I didn't know what it was. I suddenly, I, I walked, I, i, I said, I said to my girlfriend, it's, it's working. And she said, yes, it's working. I feel it also. And I went into Noell Motel, which was my favorite bar, just to be in a familiar environment. It's not a good idea on your first very strong LSD trip to be out in lower Manhattan on a Saturday night. But I also didn't know this, you know, so I was in the bar and I saw my friend Dora Espinoza from Peru. She was quite a, a small woman. Like, she was only like, I don't know the American system, like maybe one meter 50. So she was quite short, short is the right word, but on LSD, she was like this tiny. So I saw her down there like, and I said, Dora, do I look normal? Because you look very small. Yeah. And Dora's like, no, you look fine. I'm like, okay, I I I gotta get outta here. And then we walked up to Second Avenue and we saw like a bunch of Puerto Rican kids killing one of their, it was like a gang kind of, it was more of a druggie kind of, I mean, Manhattan back then was kind of dangerous in the East Village. And one of, they killed one of them on the hood of the car in front of our eyes. We saw it. And I said, do you see this? Like, oh my god. And then the, and then they resurrected him, like they gave him mouth to mouth and the guy guy was fine again. And we walked past and we, we were not sure anymore what, what we were seeing. And this was, this was a very strong hallucination. And then we saw a full blown racial riot on Second Avenue. Like people were smashing in taxi windows, pulling the drivers out, like getting like, it was like A-A-G-G-T-A"

And that the, the world was very different. And you know, just how you look at it, it looks different. And so"

Like there's also other com compounds that are quite rare, like DOM or whatever. Maybe it was something else. But then I also spoke to LSD experts by now also for the book Tripped. And it can happen that your first trip is much stronger than all the other trips because your brain is kind of reacts very strongly to it. 'cause what happens in the brain is basically that the default mode network receives less energy and other parts of the brain there think more, communicate better. So if this happens for the first time, like your brain maybe is totally surprised by this like firework that's going on and then creates like hallucinations, like somehow makes sense of it. Like there's a lot of things firing. And then so you see things that maybe are not there, but that's not usual on an LSD trip. Like you don't have, I've never had such hallucinations afterwards.

I just, 'cause it was so beautiful on this island and it was kind of, will it be more beautiful if I'm on LSD now? And of course every LSD trip also tells you about your life. Like some things you didn't understand. Suddenly you, you see like, oh, it's like this, like you, it's very good for, you know, reflecting on your life, but it's also a lot of fun.

          "value": "2 (218m 43s):\nI mean, when the Swiss pharmaceutical company Sandoz developed LSD in 1943, like they were having the, to solve the big question, what is it good for? Like, yeah, Albert Hoffman, a chemist, he found it basically involuntarily. And he reported to the CEOI had very strong reactions basically in the brain. So they set up an intoxication room. I found the documents about this intoxication room in the Novartis archive when I researched Tripped, 'cause Novartis bought Sandoz in the nineties. So all the LSD stuff is in the Novartis archive and this intoxication room. I always think it's kind of interesting to imagine this was 1943, there's a world war going on everywhere in Europe except in Switzerland, which is a neutral country. But Basel where the LSD was found is like a stone throw from the German border. So you actually hear the war going on. And so they created a, a nice room within the company and then all the employees voluntarily could go and take LSD. So they, they were the first people to take LSD and they had no idea that there was at one point, you know, MKUltra and you know, they, they were just trying out something that one of their guys had developed. And I read through all these reports and they all had a great experience. They was like sitting in a nice chair and they looked outside the window and they were like reporting stuff. Like I just had to laugh the whole time. I felt so good. I realized about my life and or it, it kind of created in them the feeling like a heightened sensi sensitivity and a feeling of that this is the li this is how life should feel kind of. So the CEO he was really trying to figure out what he could market it for because he thought maybe this is a game changer in mental health. 'cause this was before antidepressants, before anti-psychotics, and it was in the middle of World War ii, which had created already millions of traumatized people. How do you treat these people? So they thought LSD could be really a big, a big, big, big thing. And I mean, I, I came up, I just told you when I first took LSD and I somehow was interested in LSD, but I never thought I would write a book about it. I just used it once in a while when I wanted to understand something about my life. I just enjoy a day in the, in the ocean. But I read a study that micro doses of LSD at one point help against Alzheimer. And my mother has Alzheimer's. So I discussed this with my father who takes care of my mother. And this was an academic study. I, I, I discussed this also with a leading Alzheimer expert that I interviewed for Tripped. And he's like, wow, this is amazing. Like, 'cause LSD interacts with this very same receptors, the five HT two A receptors in the brain that LSD interacts with those receptors and Alzheimer destroys those receptors. So LSD basically does the opposite that Alzheimer does. And I discussed this with my father and he said, so why can't I buy LSD in the pharmacy if it's so good? You know, he was a judge before he actually put people in prison for drugs. So he said, you better bring me the story. So I did the kind of a research loop. This is book Tripped. Yeah. Then I came back to him in the end with the true story of why LSD has been made illegal. And that is quite, that is quite fascinating because the Swiss CEO, he had learned biochemistry. This is very nerdy, but I think it's quite interesting. He had learned biochemistry from the Jewish German god of biochemistry. Vita Richard Vita was Nobel prize winner for chemistry. And his work was, he would extract the potent alkaloids from so-called poisonous plants and make, you know, poison par cells all taught us, it's the dosage that makes the poison. You know, if you take too much of a potent alkaloid, maybe it's a poison, but if you, if you extract a potent alkaloid, maybe you can turn it into a medicine. So sto learned this from V and there was another guy that was learning from vi Richard Kon. So it was Kon and Sto, those were the two students of Vil Deter. And they sto left and made, became the CEO of Sandoz and developed the pharmaceutical branch of Sandoz. And Kun became Hitler leading biochemist and was responsible in finding a truth drug and also developing nerve gas. So, but the two guys Kun and stayed friends also in the Nazis took power. Like I researched the papers of ol in the archive and in the twenties he would all communicate all the ergo research, Esan ergot product. Ergot is a fungus that grows on rye. He would communicate all this with Kon and Kun would come to the Sundo lab and they did experiments together. And then in 43, Kun was, you know, a hardcore Nazi scientist and especially looking for the truth drug at the time. And I was looking through the archive, I wanted to find the connection that, you know, sto also sent LSD to Kun because when I was researching for Blitzed in Dachau, I had found that the Ss had done in the concentration camp of Dachau experiments with masculine and another hallucinogenic substance, which was not named. And masculine has the problem. The truth drug idea is I give you something without you noticing it, like something that doesn't smell or doesn't taste like anything. And then after like half an hour, I know that something's working in your brain and you become insecure because suddenly something's working in your brain. And I can play with that situation and therefore extract all the secrets from you because I, it's a power. I'm suddenly above you because I know something about you that you don't know. That was the idea. The problem with masculine was it has a bitter taste and it's kind of hard to make it. And LSD is very easy to make, not very easy, but it's quite easy. And LSD is odorless and tasteless. So I was trying to, I I somehow had the notion that LSD has a Nazi past, you know, which is something that no one ever thinks about. LSD is like the hippie drug, right? It's a drug of the peace people. But I wanted to see all the papers of this, of the CEO of sto and the archivist, he already knew, like he was the Swiss archivist. And this is not a public archive. In a public archive, you basically like a national archive of the United States. You see what's there, you have the right to see it, freedom of information. But a company archive, like Novartis archive, the archive is, can, can just say no, you know, I'm, I, I can't find this right. You know, he you basically at his mercy. So I bribed him with LSD. I said, because he didn't wanna show me, he didn't wanna show me the toilet papers. And I said to him, just to distract him, I said, did you ever, have you ever seen LSD? And he's like, no, wow, how would I see it? And I said, well, I have some here. And I had some, I just had gotten it from a friend. What does LSD look like? Tabs it? Yeah, A tab. I had a paper. And the funny thing about, yeah, this a different, you know, different design. Oh, and you could put it on your tongue. Is that right? That people usually take it. Yeah. Then you take it like that. And the one I had was given to me by a Swiss friend and it had like, here you see certain prints on it. Oh yeah. And he had the, the print was the old logo of Sandoz from the forties. So the guys who make this illegal LSD in Za and some kind of lab, they know where it comes from. So they made like a joke to make like the old logo of Sandoz. I showed this to the archives, they said, this is the old logo of our company. I said, well, it was made by your company. He said, I know this, but it was, it's not, this is very interesting actually. And I said, you, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna gift you one of these trips now. And he said, whoa, you really would do this? And I said, you can archive it. And he's like, ha ha ha. Then he actually took one. He was, and then the ice broke. That's great. And then he said, okay, I'm gonna show, you know, the correspondence of our CEO. It's no problem. And he just went to the next room and he looked for like 10 minutes. And then he brought me these boxes. And then I saw actually the correspondence between Sta and Kun, between the Swiss CEO and the German Nazi scientist, what they were talking about. And then I found a smoking gun, October, 1943. Kun acknowledges that he receives half a gram of Ergotamine, which is the precursor drug to LSD. And so it's highly, it's highly likely that the Nazis used LSD together with masculine in Dachau. And when the Americans liberated the Dachau camp, they had a special unit called Zo with them. And Zos job was to find German scientists and kind of interview them, get their knowledge for the nuclear program mostly, but also for biochemical weapons. And one of the first persons they interrogated was Richard Kun. And Richard Kun immediately collaborated because he didn't want to Go to the Nuremberg trial, he wanted to continue his career. Actually he was an opportunist. So I guess his Nazi convictions were not so strong after all, because he also liked the Americans. So he is like, he told the Americans immediately about LSD. And the next day, a very high general flew from the states to Frankfurt, went to Heidelberg, spoke to Kon again, went then took off his uniform and went in civil clothing to Basel because Switzerland is neutral and received the first LSD from Sto Sun. So he, the American general had LSD, this was in 45 in the summer. And then the American military started to examine LSD, could LSD be the true drug? Because if the Nazis think so, maybe it's true, you know, because the Nazis were, you know, cutting edge scientists as evil as they were"

Still still wanted to put it on the market, but Sidney Gotlieb, the head of MKUltra, he really didn't want LSD to be on the market. He wanted not because he thought it's not good or dangerous for anybody. He just wanted to control LSD. He wanted LSD to be his, so he could use it for MKUltra for experiments. He didn't, but he couldn't really stop. There was also legit LSD research always going on in until it was prohibited in 1966. There was legit LSD research done in universities, which came to all kinds of, you know, conclusions. But the decisive thing was a visit by Gotlieb in the office of Uhto in Basel where he basically says to, he comes with a suitcase with 240,000 US dollars to buy the world supply of LSD. And because he, he, he has the information from the American ambassador, like he has, he said like, I think we think by now Sandoz has produced like 400 kilograms of LSD. So that was the price for these four. Oh. And Andto said, no, actually we have produced only 400 grams And, but I I, I'll sell everything to you. Of course, I mean, because the pressure that he received from the CIA was 'cause the CIA and the FDA, they're like quite friendly organizations. So the CIA has a certain influence on the FDA, at least back then, you know, so the, the pressure was if you want to put your medicines on the market, which is of course the biggest market in the world, and Sandoz, you know, I'm sure you wanna thrive. And as a pharmaceutical company, then LSD is not gonna be one of these products and basically betrayed LSD. So he said, okay, and LSD was only distributed as a research drug. It was never sold by the company. So researchers could actually write to Sundas and say, I, I'm doing this and this test, and I, new neuroscientist, I need LSD. And then they would receive it. But mostly what happened to the LSD was it went into the CIA's hands, and then it was used in MKUltra, but then it spilled out obviously. 'cause one of the Guinea pigs was cani. He received 75 US dollars for taking LSD for the CIA A and he was working in Menlo Park in a psychiatric ward. And on LSD, he basically had the idea to write one flu over the Cuckoo's Nest. He understood, you know, that these people maybe are not crazy. It's just a different way of seeing that's like, that's like an LSD revelation. These are not bad, crazy people. They just see the world differently because that neuroplasticity, that kind of leads you away from one way of thinking. You realize that there's different ways. So it, it does, I would say, LSD, the tendency of LSD is more to increase"

And we did do the LSD, the three of us on Christmas, and we did mushrooms on Mother's Day. And whenever my mother takes LSD and Alzheimer's, A ha has a horrible disease, obviously. For example, on Mother's Day, there was the newspaper lying on the balcony. We were like sitting in the sun and she was on mushrooms. It it's just microdose, you know, it's not that you have a trip, but you have that stimulation of the, of, of, of your brain. That's what you have. Even in her brain, attacked by Alzheimer reacted stronger than my father. Like he, he always says, I never feel anything from a microdose, and you're not supposed to feel anything. But my mother suddenly picked up the newspaper, which she hadn't looked at for a year. So on mushroom micro doses, she picks up the newspaper and starts reading the headline to us, which was about the Ukraine war. And she'd never heard about the Ukraine war. So when she, like, she had problems like pronouncing the word Ukraine, because that was a new word for her because she hadn't, you know, been part of the news cycle in about a year.

Kind of when I see like, just these great writers in history talk about writing, it seems like it's really hard. It's a kind of torture, you know, Hemingway and you know, there you have the Kerouac stories that you, you just kind of flows out of you, but a lot of times it's like really disciplined day after day, you're really digging and digging. And so it's interesting what that looks like under the different supplements, right? Like, well, Stephen King, famously, I mean, there's a lot of people, you know, they Go to the drugs, to the alcohol. You have the Hunter s Thompson who goes, you know, when given the option just says yes to all of it. And the mind is a weird thing. And, and a lot of writers talk about, like, they're not really developing the ideas. They're plugging into some, they're channeling a voice from somewhere else. And with psychedelics, that's certainly, it feels like you're modifying the channel or you're expanding the channel. Yeah. Or you're directing the channel to a different direction. That's why I ask."

Well, first of all, it's this one, it's this discipline. I can do it up in the Nietzche house. I can also do it sometimes in Berlin. It's just sitting there trying to focus and writing. But what you need, of course, is the inspirational part. And LSD helped me just the first trip to realize that it's not all black and white. The world's quite colorful and there there's like the abyss and it's, there's also the horror. And like, I was, I was a happy go lucky kid, you know, I, I never thought it, the world is so deep as I understand it now. So the LSD makes the world deeper. So I think for me to understand the world better, to understand myself better, to it improve my writing. But I would not write on LSD because on LSD you're like, you wanna walk in the forest or you want to go up the mountain, or, that's what I like, I don't, I would never like sit in front of the ugly computer with a stupid, like screen and write, you know, maybe I would lie in the mountains with a, a notebook and kind of write like poetic lines. And I, that could be done on LSD. Because you have, like, when I was researching stone sapiens, I did one LSD trip and from Thehow I went quite high up in the mountains on LSD. And I came and it was not, I just, it's just, I just thought about the book and kind of looked at the different chapters. Does it work together? Like, kind of like macro without taking too many notes, just kind of letting it, you know, play out in front of, in, in my mind. And then, but then when I walked down, I ca I passed a cave and I realized a lot about people's relationship to caves and the cave paintings. How, you know, actually the, the, the, the cave walls, you see all the arteries of the rocks. And I mean on LSD you see all of that and you like see how alive that is and how beautiful it actually was by humans to then use that canvas and, and and, and work your, your cave paintings in there. I mean I never had thep appreciation of that before."

Like from my perspective, and maybe you can comment on it in general, when people ask me, 'cause I've done psilocybin a few times and I've did ayahuasca and I've talked about it. When people ask me if I recommend those things, I, as a general statement, I say no, you know, to the general population. And then as a second step, if I'm talking to specific people on a case by case basis, I can just discuss my experience and let that be kind of an inspiration is I'm very hesitant to recommend a thing that could be so powerful because I don't know. Yeah. Like I had a tremendously positive experience and I was sure I would be meeting some demons. Like I thought I would have some demons in the basement or something, but I didn't meet 'em. Not yet. And my, but people might have some demons that they meet and that it might destroy them or it might change them in the way don't, they don't like, and, and actually it's a good question for me whether it's good to do psychedelics when you're in a good place in life or in a bad place in life. Because I know that, you know, even scientifically there've been studies where psilocybin helps with extreme sort of with depression and PTSD and all these kinds of things. But I'd be very nervous about that too because like the mind is such a powerful thing and it's such a complicated thing that with these really powerful tools, it's unclear where it's going to take you. But I have heard a lot of stories of people have taken incredible journeys, sometimes difficult journeys with psychedelics and have come out much happier and much freer and have have healed some of the things that we've been going through. But if when people ask me to recommend or not, I'm just too afraid to say yes. I think, I think the right thing is always, as a general, no, be very careful."

Like even a, the strongest snake poison cobra tox, if you use that in microgram dosages, you don't feel anything. But if you take 250 micrograms of LSD, it can totally overpower you. And if you have an unstable psyche, it could, you know, make turn you mad. You know?"

And I spoke to a neuroscientist from university clinic in Zurich who's been researching psilocybin and LSD since the early nineties. And he puts people in, in brain scanners, for example. So he sees exactly what happens in the brain on LSD or in psilocybin. And he said to me when I asked him that very same question, he said, LSD is the most sophisticated molecule he meant by that, is that LSD docks onto more receptors than psilocybin. Like psilocybin interacts with like five receptor different types of receptors in the brain. And LSD like with nine. So that makes LSD more complex molecule. So the, that's why it already works in very small quantities because it's like the key is like perfect for our brain. Our brain really reacts strongly to LSD. For mushroom psilocybin, you have to take milligrams, not micrograms, but milligrams. So mushrooms is also described as softer, you know, psychedelic experience because it only lasts for like five hours while LSD lasts like eight hours. And LSD can be more, LSD is also a mushroom, but it's, it's, it's, it's ergo, which is a mushroom, but it's turned into a dema. It's the, you extract the potent acid from Ergod, which is liturgic acid, and you turn that into a ide. So it's a process drug in a way. It's a potent process drug that works also for mass movements quite well. That's why it was so popular in the sixties. 'cause people could just make it why mushrooms, they kind of, they have to grow like the, the hippie movement. They could never have, you know, sus sustained on mushrooms because so many mushrooms don't even grow. But a good LSD chemist can make LSD for the whole world basically."

You know, electronic music is dead, but obviously it's not dead, it's still going on. But in the nineties it was new, so it was, you really went into the club and you heard something you'd never heard before. And the first time I came from New York and New York was a very old school kind of urban place. I mean rock and roll or grunge music. And I came to Berlin, it was in a club called Ima Bucket in East Berlin. Doesn't exist anymore. Like in a rundown, totally rundown like a squat. And I, I went to the bar and I had a beer and I looked and there was just a few people on the dance phone, like in this like electronic music, which I'd never heard before. And the guy in front of me, he was like, he looked like an East Berlin skinhead kind of type of guy, but like, totally smiling, I'm sure he was an ecstasy and he was disassembling like an imaginary machine. And I just looked at this guy, he was like, for one hour he was just like, doing the most Yeah. Complicated like things. And I was like, this is totally a totally different way of, of, of moving. And I liked that actually. I, I liked to dance in clubs. Yeah. And I did this for like two years very intensely with my girlfriend at the time. We went out a lot like from Friday to Monday, basically. But it means, and lot, a lot of people still do that in Berlin, but it means that you cannot really work. I mean, yeah, you"

It feels very toxic. Like when you take a psychedelic, I can say this with a clear conscience, it's not toxic. LSD is not toxic. It doesn't poison you. You might have reactions in your brain that are too much for you, but if you snort crystal meth, it goes on your central nervous system, your heart starts pounding, your blood pressure rises. So it's stressful on the organism, it's toxic, you know, but still, you know, the effect in the brain is not so interesting. As with LSD. Like you couldn't go crazy. I would say on, on crystal meth, you just have like, you just very much awake, but you don't have like crazy thoughts that you can't, you know, evaluate anymore. So it's a very, very, very different drug. But taking that of course made me understand better how a soldier feels in the tank taking it."

And I do it sometimes, but I don't do it a lot, you know, so I can take amphetamines and have a really good time and write like 20 pages, but then the next day I wouldn't do it any, I wouldn't do it anymore. But he decided, okay, for 14 days I'm gonna do it. Philip k Dick was an amphetamine writer. And also I think if you take a lot of amphetamines, you get into kind of psychedelic spaces at a certain point in time where you start hallucinating and like if you ride a, you know, blade runner, maybe it helps you. So amphetamines are also, they can be creative, I guess it's just not, I don't, it's not my type of, of drug and they're certainly not as creative as, but it also depends on the person. Like Malcolm Lori under the volcano, he was drinking a lot or Hemingway was drinking a lot and they could only write when they're drunk. When I'm drunk, I can't write, I just can't do it. Write"

Like if I would write something on amphetamines, I would certainly edit it sober of course, because on amphetamines, your self-criticism is lowered because you feel so good. Like you feel so confident, you just write. And, but writing is about nuances, especially literary writing. Maybe a nonfiction book would be easy on amphetamines. But a novel, it's all about, you have to be very, very open. Amphetamines close you, you become like a machine, like you write. But if you are on the right track, like Kerik was on the road, he had the right, you know, he was on, he was going, you know, but you could also be on the wrong one and then write 200 pages and you just have to throw it away. And probably he did a lot of that also, you know?"

Ulysses is good, but only when you're like in your early twenties living in New York and you're writing your first book and you just have taken LSD. Oh, nice. Then I read it and then it opened. It made sense. Well it just showed, it's just a very experimental novel. So it opens up, you don't have to understand everything, but it shows you that there's many different ways of telling a tale. And that was, that was quite interesting to me. But the most influential book maybe is The Stranger by Camu."

This is world literature. He said, yeah, right. He is like killing an Arab without Conseque. No, actually there is consequence, but no reason. Basically just because he is bored. So this is racist.

And I think not every, I mean, but it's, that's his tendency. He tries to write like this. And that's very hard to achieve. That's actually where the writing becomes poetic. So for me, Nietzche also is like a poet. The aphorisms is poetry. So Nietzsche also stylistically, since you asked, was very important to me. So Ka Nietzche, James Joyce, and then just Kafka also, I like Kafka always. And I like Thomas man. I don't know how well he translates, but in German it's interesting his take on how to, it's funny, he's very, he's a very funny guy, even though he is like, he talks too much, but he's good. So I always wanted to have these guys as my colleagues basically."

Let's say you become a carpenter, which is also, you know, a very challenging job, but you don't have these kind of great, well, you have Jesus, I guess as you're called, potential colleague. Yeah, true. But for the, I, I just like these writers, these two, so the ones I mentioned, and also then Thomas Thomas Pin who wrote Gravity's Rainbow, which I think is one of the best novels in the 20th century. And I read that in Berlin in the late nineties. And it really blew my mind. I thought it, I think it's an absolute masterpiece. The intensity of this novel, gravity's rainbow is unparalleled. And I'm still puzzled by how he did it. And it's not known how he did it, because he lives, he lives a completely obscure life. No one knows basically who he is. So he is also very interesting colleague."

Perhaps only a rich person can say this, but there's nothing more exhilarating than saying no to a lot of money. But he said, he said, it was so much confidence that I somehow believed him. But it is, the more, the deeper truth there is living by principles and having integrity, there is, there is something deeply fulfilling. What if that means saying no to money, or if that means standing up to Hitler, that's a, and then risking your life. That's a deeply fulfilling thing. Big ridiculous question.

So the consciousness of the whole, of the universe, the big, the huge story is something that is probably the meaning of life and or the meaning of life, of our individual life, is to understand that story. And that that is something, for example, that I understood quite well on LSD when I walked in the mountains about a month ago. Because the mountains, they actually, you know, they, they're quite high up into the atmosphere and they're made of all kinds of minerals. And so they are receiving cosmic energy that comes, you know, that hits our planet and walking up there, and it doesn't, I guess if you are on LSD, you're more open somehow because you're not closing with your default mode network that you know, this is the tree and this is the path and this is the mountain, and now it's two o'clock and I have to go back. And the rain like this, you're more, you're more open. So you're more like perceiving. I, I, that's at least the, that's the impression I had. And I couldn't put it in words what exactly I was perceiving, but I was perceiving more of the bigger story. And I think that is inspiration. And I think those moments bring you quite close to the meaning of life. And I wouldn't, I wouldn't put that meaning on life in words. It, it, it is an experience. And I think that for me as an artist, it was an important experience to make, to get close to that. And, and that is, that is what you can achieve in each of your professions. You know, like a mathematician. He comes to that point when he like, hears more like he grasps like connections. And he might not be able to put it into a formula yet, but if he's, if he's an open person, he might be a better mathematician because he can understand a bit more of, of, of the meaning of everything,"

Because if we live, that's why I like to be in nature also quite a lot. You, you get, you get how you have a better access. We live boxed in, called us like the boxed human beings. Like we're living in the cities, we're doing, we're waking up, we're doing like it's good to be, therefore it's good to be outside the system. And I hope that my art can contribute to, you know, freeing the brainwaves to, you know, understanding a bit more what that is. I don't know. But I think the process of understanding more and, and connecting in different ways, that is what I'm going for because I think that is the meaning of life."

Thanks for listening to this conversation with Norman Ohler to support this podcast. Please Check out our sponsors in the description and consider subscribing to this channel. And now lemme leave you with some words from the great Terrance McKenna. Nature loves courage. You make the commitment and nature will respond to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles. Dream the impossible dream and the world will not grind you under. It will lift you up. This is the trick. This is what all these teachers and philosophers who really counted, who really touched the alchemical gold, this is what they understood. This is the shamanic dance in the waterfall. This is how magic is done by hurling yourself into the abyss and discovering that it is in fact a feather bed. Thank you for listening and to see you next time."
