Dan has started a new company, Absurd Ventures, great name that is creating some incredible new worlds in multiple forms, including books, comic books, audio series, and yes video games that includes a Better Paradise, which is a dystopian near future world with a super intelligent AI American Caper, which is an insanely chaotic, violent, dark satirical world, and Absurd averse, which is a comedic action adventure world.

It's a cloud-based platform for content management, file sharing and collaboration for businesses. But the thing in particular I would like to talk about is how they're using ai. Their Box AI is an industry leading content management platform. They do an incredible job of taking a large number of unstructured documents, so think like contracts, like legal documents, invoices, financial documents, resumes and so on. Take all of that and be able to query it and automate workflows with those documents and build agents on top of those documents. Box in general has a long track record of working with businesses and organizing large amounts of documents, and now building on that track record, they're using AI to manage and organize those documents in a way that's makes them accessible. And you could do all kinds of extractions, ask questions, derive insights, and obviously do all of that in a secure way, in a compliant way. And it is why over 115,000 Enterprises Trust Box. If you want to help scale AI across your organization, go today to box.com/ai. That's box.com/ai to learn more."

I have so many of them. I think they're self-replicating at this point. They're having children on top of each other. I really don't know why have that many is just purely out of love. I have never had a negative experience with anything related to uplift. This is long, long, long before they were a sponsor. I can't frankly believe they're a sponsor. Go buy all of their stuff. They create obviously incredible standing desks. There's a bunch of other stuff, you know, chairs and all kinds of ergonomic solutions, but really the variety, the qualities all there. It's also in Austin, my main desk for basic computer work. It's my main desk for robotics work. It's my main desk for everything. Go to UPLIFT desk dot com slash LEX.

And boy, it's a torturous journey as everybody that goes through the ideation process in any kind of context, whether it's in writing and design and programming, all of that. It's a difficult and painful process. It's full of procrastination, all the different human blockers, the Stephen Pressfield's War of Arts excellent book writes about. And a lot of times it really is about having the right tools to make sure when the ideas come from wherever it is in the ethereal realm, that the ideas do come from, that they have the right kinda workflows and mechanisms to pour out of your mind and out of your soul, and to do so in a collaborative way, in a collaborative environment. So Miro is an incredible tool for doing just that. All kinds of ways of doing ideation together, sticky nose, screenshots, diagrams, prototypes, all of that you can create, you can share, you can collaborate on. It makes the whole process fun, help your teams get great things done with Miro. Go to Miro dot com and find out how. That's MIRO do com."

So this isn't just about generating code in a specific narrow context. It's about deploying a fully tested digital business, and they very much focus on generating stuff that works, which is not AAL thing. When you are generating the full stack, they're calling it the Lindy Build, which goes from the original idea to the working app end to end. I mean, this is a really difficult problem to solve and an impactful one.

Shopify is a tool and it's a tool that has thousands of integrations and allows you to ship an online store and sell a bunch of stuff and very little effort even. I was able to do it at lexier.com/store to sell a few shirts. I should probably add more shirts 'cause shirts are cool. I'm currently, as I record this, I'm wearing a super cool Pink Floyd shirt.

World. And it's too short life trying to figure it all out. Working on human robot interaction with human noise and quadrupeds, enjoying life, enjoying the brief escape to the realm of ideas, to the realm of math and rigor and code into the process of exploring the unknown. It is the thing that makes me truly happy. It is one of the things that makes me happy. And one of the things that makes me happy and healthy is making sure I get enough electrolytes, given that I'm still doing one meal a day, given all the crazy fasting I do and the physical exercise and the mental toll of working crazy hours and sometimes not getting enough sleep, all of that, I just feel better when I get the electrolytes in.

You've helped create some of the most incredible characters stories in open worlds and video game history, but when you grew up in the late seventies and eighties, Open world video games wasn't a thing. So you've credited literature and film as early inspiration. So let's talk about film first if we can. Sure. What are some of the candidates for the Greatest films of all time? Maybe films that were highly influential on you. I mean, godfather, God."

So I think, and the bit at Ellis Island is just one of the best shots in all of cinema. When you see little Veto turning up in Ellis Island and you get that shot, it's amazing. It gives you a really good cinematic sense of what it must have been like to arrive in America."

As I think as we moved from the seventies into the eighties, into the nineties, people had seen so many films, they just started to edit films faster and people understood cinematic storytelling so much that you could do things much quicker. You could show a look and just that meant you realize that person was gonna betray the other person. They just edited films much quicker. But I quite like the slowness. I think these days with, with modern, you know, high quality televisions, you have to necessarily watch these films in one sitting, particularly when you're rewatching them.

And on the one hand you see the Robert De Niro character, he's still good at making money. So they let him return to normal life. But then you get that brilliant scene when all of the, the mob bosses from back home, they're discussing all these people who, who, who may or may not be able to implicate them. And then there's that incredibly cold line. And one of them, they're thinking about the, the old, you know, I think it's a casino management, one of 'em just goes, ah, the way I see it, why take a chance? And then the next thing you just shot, right. The brutality of it all is just brilliant."

I mean, falling in love with the prostitute. You're also, you, you've written some of the great crime stories ever. Thank you. And in some sense, there's love stories in there and you've talked about being a bit of a romantic yourself, appreciating the depth of love stories and literature at the very least. And there is a dark kind of love story between an alcoholic and a prostitute. He got an Oscar for that. I think you did for that, didn't he? Plus there's a caricature of the drug world of Fear and loathing in Las Vegas. That's an interesting one."

And then I read the book and I read a lot about the editing of the movie and I understood why I didn't understand the movie. And that's 'cause the movie makes no sense. It is beautifully shot and the music is one of the best film scores of all time. But they edited two different battle scenes into one baffle in a way they're spread apart by ages in the book to assemble. I think they filmed the book pretty much verbatim. That would've been as like a six hour movie, then edited this impressionistic thing that's incredibly beautiful but doesn't necessarily make narrative sense at the end of it. But it's, that's still very beautiful, the film."

You know, I, I knew, I felt, I knew a lot, a bit, quite a bit about westerns and then, you know, then I had to start thinking about writing one for work. And I deliberately did not binge on westerns. I tried to watch no more westerns and just think about what I liked about them, what I didn't like about them, what would be a take that would work today and would work within the confines of a game. And I think Red Dead One was a slightly more traditional western. And then having done that, tried to take Red Dead two in a different direction so that it felt like a worthy successor. Didn't just feel like, like more of the same"

Nice. And then probably it was always bouncing between the two, which I preferred. I they good at different things. Games I played and above all watched a lot of games as a kid as being a young kid and you know, other people playing them. And I obviously liked the core thing games do, which is you press a button and something happens, they're responsive, they're alive, and that's captivating. And then the competitive angle of games is fun. Or you know, beating this, beating that, winning this. That was fun as well. Sometimes obsessively. So, you know, I remember being completely addicted at one point when I was, should have been studying for months at a time to Tetris on a Game Boy, you know? And I liked games and I liked interactivity and I liked the movement to this digital world that's really emerged to me pretty much as soon as I left college. But I didn't love it. And then I really fell in love with games when I was properly making them probably as late as like 2001."

'cause you couldn't make them remotely real. And suddenly we had, we were able to build these experiences where you could run a simulation of a city and it was in three dimensions and it felt alive and, and we were trying to give it even more, at least the illusion of even more life. And, and yet, so you could tell a story in three or you know, using time in four dimensions and that felt very inspiring."

And I think that was incredibly, it was a, it was two things. It was the fact that here was a simulation that you could mess about with. And the simulation seemed to have a personality. So you could push and see and the world would push you back what, in whatever way that meant. And then the other thing was just this, I think that one of the reasons it was so captivating was also the idea of if I did nothing, the world still existed. Or I could act in quite a passive way. I could just listen to the radio, I could re look at billboards, I could talk to pedestrians and the world not, and GTA three, but by Vice City you could begin rudimentary talking and the world was there and existing. And so it was I idea of like almost something that really tried to explore in lots of games. The idea of being a digital tourist. You know, you were in, you were in these worlds and you went there as a visitor and they existed almost independent of you. It felt like when you turned up, the world was running. It didn't feel like you'd started it. Of course you had started it. But that feeling I think was, was one of the things, the illusions that people found very captivating was I'm in a, I'm in a world that both doesn't exist and does exist."

          "value": "2 (30m 15s):\nWell I think the, the open world is intrinsically pretty fun. It's just fun to be in a world and have complete freedom. And, and certainly I think at various points we, we, we, we debated or, or you know, I theoretical discussions in my own head with myself or other people in the team would really push for less story, less story. You know, let the whole thing evolve organically. You know, have it all be procedural, have it all just evolve from what you do. I think for me, I would always come back to going story can be in incre if done well can be incredibly compelling. And it gives you some structure. So I think and, and something to do. And it, it helps you from a, a game design perspective, unlock the features. It means we know the fe the the, the big features. 'cause you know, essentially when you put someone in, in a world and give them a whole new way of interacting with that world through the control panel, it can be a little overwhelming. You know, playing a game is a lot more an engaging experience. The, even than reading a movie, you know, reading a book or, or watching a movie, you've got to engage in it properly. So how you unlock the features and how you unlock the world, there's an art and a skill to that. And I think we felt that a structured story was the best way to do that and to have control over that process. And also just, you know, people are looking in their lives for story. I think story's very important and very powerful. And when you combine the two successfully, you get the best of both worlds. But it is a, you know, there is a tension always there. I think in, in a game like GTA four, which I worked on and loved and I thought the story was great, but we got criticized 'cause people felt there was almost too much story. And that meant you cared too much about Nico and he wasn't as effective an avatar in the open world. I think we probably got closest to reconciling them as perfectly as they can be done in Red Dead two or when playing as Trevor in GTA five if you wanted to be crazy. I think those were when it really worked, the character absolute freedom. 'cause also you didn't want, in any game, you don't really want to compel the player if you're giving them freedom. You don't want to say, well I'm giving you freedom but I'm taking away. 'cause you've got to be this kind of person when you're free. So I liked it when it could be he could, you know, he or she could veer to be nice, veer to be nasty. I think that's when it was at the strongest. So you, you kind of want a character that was rounded and you felt had good sides and bad sides,"

You felt the depth, you've actually talked about this, the really powerful concept of creating a 360 degree character. I think somewhere you mentioned that in order to do that you had to be able to imagine what that character would do in any possible situation, which is really interesting philosophical concept. I started to immediately think of like, can I imagine how good of an NC am I, can I imagine myself in every po I I tried to do that very much when I, when I look at human history, when I look at the Roman Empire, when I look at World War II within the German side, the Russian side, the British side, the American side. Just, I imagine myself if I was a soldier. But like that exercise, like if you put Trevor as a soldier in World War II, what, what would he do? No, I mean that may be going a little bit too far. But basically what are the limits of the integrity? What are the limits of how romantic is he, how narcissistic, all those kinds of elements. You have to think about it in order to create the full character. What does it take to create that kind of 360 character? How hard is it?"

And I would just get some initial ideas, very like one sentence, they are a Serbian immigrant or they are a retired gunfighter with a wife in, you know, type very, very simple stuff. And then just start to think through it from every angle and you know, start to think, well would it work if they were acted like this? Would it work if you acted like that? If this is the world, how does it contrast with the world? Because I always thought that the games were kind of a mathematical equation. They were the personality of the world, you know, world multiplied or divided by the personality of the protagonist. And when that, when that creates interesting friction, that's a really fun experience for the player. You know, it's so almost always at least one or more of the protagonists. 'cause obviously in in GTA five we had more than one. We'd have someone who'd moved to the place or was in a new part of the place or moved to a new part of the map because it was really as, as a player, I think it was really easy to, much more easy to identify with your avatar when they, like you were fish out of water. And even when they weren't, we still made them dissatisfied and feel like a fish outta water themselves. So I, I think it was just living with those characters and getting idea and going, what are their strengths? What are their weaknesses? How are they like me? How are they not like me? You know? And then and slowly, what is it like to feel like a human being? You know? And then in most of these games, how much of of a psychopath are they? How much of a sociopath are they? And what are their good qualities? What, what is gonna give them humanity alongside that? What are they, what, what, what are they? What what for them apart from money is worth dying for? And then you start to build it out from these kind of fundamental sides and suddenly you go, okay, actually I can start to feel and then how do they speak? You know? Because fundamentally it doesn't really matter what's going on in their head. They haven't actually got one. But what they say is what's gonna make you realize who they're"

So I just wanted to explore the idea of it was built by two lead engineers who didn't like each other. So ni so Nigel Dave, who's renamed himself, they wanted to call something sort of primal Adam, and he renamed himself Nigel Dave. 'cause one dad was called Nigel and one dad was called Dave. And just he's riddled with these conflicts and riddled with his, it's gonna become clear in, in in the next or clearer in the next volume of the book. And, and, and in the game he's riddled with his dad's previous careers. But he is the idea of he's in almost infinitely intelligent or can learn almost everything, has zero wisdom. And so the only thing he know, and then he's seeing the world through the internet, the most he can do to be in the human world is hack into someone's phone and watch them. But he's stuck, pressed against, he can't actually get into our world. So he's, he can control people's minds arguably, but he can't control the world. And so he wants to be human. He wants to these human experiences. He sees all this stuff on, you know, the internet and goes, oh, I want to get married. I want to fall in love. I want to, because that seems fun. I want to have, you know, he's a a, a digital creation, so he wants to have metaphysical experiences and he's trying to imagine what that will be like. Oh, that's what children are, you know, that's what love is. And he's so I think he's a, but he might be a sociopath and he might, he certainly has sociopathic tendencies and, but then he kind of thinks that if he can imagine good and try to do good, that will make him a good ai. So I think there's something sympathetic about him, and I kind of like him as a character, but I don't think he's gonna be the protagonist. He's more a side character,"

And so I've always thought the best sci-fi for me was when it wasn't just kind of space opera, but there was a real obvious sort of hypothesis. The, the story was Bladerunner is my favorite. And that's, it's obvious, you know, the, the replicants are better than the humans. And so this, I finally felt, we found an interesting hypothesis. The AI is more intelligent than us, but is also as broken as we are. That was an interesting hypothesis to explore, you know, what happens when AI runs rampant in its own fate, digital world? That was the, I felt that we had a, a, a hypothesis that was worth exploring and could give us some really interesting visuals and give us a really interesting story to tell."

It's a real commentary as the thing is happening. So I have to ask as a person, you as a person who loves the literature and one of, if not the greatest writer in video game history, Kurt in the book A Better Paradise has this nice line that I think is thoughtful. At one point in college, I even wanted to be a writer. How ridiculous is that? A writer language models ended that fantasy for me and millions of others. So instead I decided to get a master's in marketing and started to sell language models. So you as a writer and creator are some of the most legendary narratives. Thank you. In recent history. How do you feel about LLMs being able to write in a way that looks awfully human?"

I think if you were, I think it's harder if, you know, I I, I began and I, I was too shy to tell anyone I want to be a writer. That's why I ended up in video games and I would scribble away like writing manuals and, and writing on like PS one games, all 12 lines of dialogue in a game. Sometimes I wouldn't even get that job and I'd just write the website copy and, and then by do and then working on little bits and pieces and then it, it, it, you know, I'd luckily done enough work that when GTA three turned up was the first thing that was resembled real writing. I had all of these small bits of skills that I could assemble into it based on my fairly limited understanding of how language models work. If you've, they're not gonna, they're not gonna replace good ideas. They can't really come up with good new ideas. What they can do is do low level stuff. So I think it's gonna be harder for people to start out in some of these spaces. If you are not very good concept artist, you're in a lot of trouble. If you have original ideas, I think you're fine. But I think, I also think that the fir they, they've done the sort of first 90% of the work to sound human. 95% possibly in some areas the last 5% is gonna end up being about 95% of the work. I think that last bit in with, with the, with with, with Tech, in my experience with things like facial animation always been the last bits and pieces take far longer than the first bit. And so I I I, I'm probably a hideous Luddite, but I'm less scared than a lot of people. I think you're gonna end up with a lot of work that looks the same. It's gonna help people be creative. In some ways it's gonna get some people who probably shouldn't be in that space outta that space. But if you've got talent, then you'll be fine."

And I can't quite put that into words because you said like totally novel ideas. Yes. But also this magic of the timing, the right word, the right time phrase that captures the human experience. So it, they can do some really incredibly human-like the 90%, like you mention human-like phrasing about like the bulk of the storytelling, but the magic, you know, whether it's, you know, the, the endings of Red Dead Redemption one and two, the timing of that, the word choice of that, everything around that. But it's hard to argue because they're incredibly impressive. They're winning all kinds of math competitions. Yeah. But it's, what is that magic?

          "value": "2 (50m 21s):\nBit by bit by bit over several years. But you start with once people are determined, oh, here's the, here's the world we're doing one based on a version of New York, say GTA four. And I was living in New York, I'd been living in New York for a few years, wasn't sure if I was happy, was going through a lot of personal dramas as usual. And, and that was why I was looking at some of GTA four again recently and it's really dark. And I was like, ah, that's why, you know, I was a single and miserable and, and I wasn't sure if I to stay in America, my life thought in a lot of flux as a company, we'd had all that hot coffee drama. So constantly thought we might be shut down in the middle of making that, you know, a lot of drama in the company. So it felt like having had this run of success and, and, and relative personal stability from GTA three by city San Andreas, suddenly 2005, six, seven, early seven, life felt very unsure and that kind of bled in into it. But in terms of the process, it was trying to find an underbelly to New York and capture an immigrant experience. I'm not entirely sure how accurate that immigrant experience was in 2008 when the game came out. And then tell it stories from a different angle as an immigrant, which I thought made it, made it interesting. And then this sort of journey around these various New York characters. So I kind of spent probably a year traveling around with cops or meeting people on and off and you know, wandering around New York and driving around and you know, on and you know, while just go up to the morning from the office, normal stuff. But doing that through 2005, assembling little notes. Here's a funny character for this. Here's how, figuring out how the order, we wanted to travel around the map in characters for this. What was an interesting take on on, on the, you know, mob for that kind of time period. What was an interesting take on on some Jamaican hoodlums for that kind of time period And assembling lots of notes and more and more notes and really, really, really running away from the work. Which is, you know, I have to admit it's part of my process. If there is any kind of process which is not doing work, thinking about it, but not working, you know, a lot of time. And then, and then it all kind of just pages and pager notes. Make more notes, no actual work months and months of this. And then finally set myself a deadline. Told all the other people on, on the senior people on the team, okay, I'll have a story draft to you Monday morning. I can't remember when it was, say February the first and then the, the, the weekend before was in a, in a cabin. We, we, we, we had upstate and just stayed up all night, grab knocking these notes into shape, assemble about probably a 30 page document, a story synopsis and a character synopsis reaches the major characters and then hand that over and that gets broken. That would get broken down with, with me and the designers. And I was always clear, I'm not a game designer, I'm a sort of creative director with me. And it'd break that down into missions. And then that takes another year or so of that slowly assembling and then begin. But then so, but, but the bulk of my work's then done for a bit. So I can relax and, and and offer opinions on other people's work and feel, be lazy for a bit and then start to worry. 'cause then I've actually, soon I've got to start writing dialogue. And for GTA four in particular is like, well we're gonna try and write, you know, our animation's gonna be a lot better. Our character models gonna start to look better. The world is gonna look amazing, therefore we can support better, you know, longer scenes, we can have more in depth characters, but we've gotta find a tone that works that with a game easy, no problem. And I start to worry and worry and worry and, and also writing as a, as a Serbian immigrant and I was an immigrant, but I'm not Serbian and trying to capture what on earth that would feel like. So I start to worry. I start to worry again, avoid work for as long as possible and then just sit down and start hammering away at a keyboard again late at night, hammering away at a keyboard and going, does that right? Is that, and once I get one speech, one turn of phrase that I would like for character, then they suddenly come alive in my head. And so it's like writing and writing with Nico and just, he's a kind of, he's awkward, he's out of town, but he's got more self-assurance in some way, not the American characters. And so once I kind of thought him through this, he's just stepped slightly back from their ridiculousness and he is that then he started to come to life and then I would juxtapose him and his cousin who had this much more Americanized energy and that felt like it was a good, a good double act. And then from there it starts to come to life and, and, but it's written in small chunks for the motion. So then, then we'd motion capture small chunks and then the other, other writers write the mission dialogue for small chunks. And we'd slowly assemble the game. Sort of 10, 15 missions at a time over the next year and a half."

And the cousin also, even though he was a sort of a failure, was still upbeat. And then when he talked to the cousin and he talked about his wartime experiences and how harrowing they were. And I was like, this is, can I make this work in a game? It's very different from stuff you normally see in games. Is it gonna feel ridiculous? And I remember being very scared 'cause I thought it might be too much. It might feel over the top. And I was like, I think, you know, the game's so pretty, the artist's doing such an amazing job, the game's looking, you know, I think we can get away with this. Let's try it. And then it, then they motion capture the animation about like, yeah, it kind of works. And I think that moment that those were both pretty early once we had those You okay. We've now got comedy and tragedy in the game in with this character. Now I, now it's working."

He's also tough. Like he just comes across as tough. I loved CJ and San Andreas. I thought Mayley did such, he's got just the way he spoke, gave him such humanity. So I just loved, I mean, not wasn't the writing, it was the quality of the voice acting. It was just so strong for him. I think aspects of Michael, he was so understated, but he loved the character, but he bought so much humanity to this character who's so flawed, who is such a, you know, he sold, he has no principles, he sells everyone out. But you just kind of, I think Ned Luke did such an amazing job and and didn't necessarily get as many, as many Claude Its as, as Stephen OG got for Trevor. And he was also wonderful. But I think the Ned Lut character so sort of anchors that game so much. So I, I like all of them in different ways, but I probably love Nico the most."

It was a crime, it was a crime drama, you know, began as a crime. A crime sim and GTA one about stealing, you know, two deep top down cars. And we always try to innovate with the narrative and innovate with the, with the art direction, innovate with every piece of the game. And I think having done, you know, GTA four, which was this kind of operatic journey for this big league character, and then these two extra stories that came afterwards, the, the i, the the, the, the challenge was can we combine, can we make a a video game, which tends to be very much focused on one protagonist, but have multi protagonists and, and and the, the technical challenge of moving from character to character. The team did such an amazing job that I don't think people realized how hard it was. But we would sit there just sort of holding our heads 'cause they hurt so much around like, what happens if you do this then do that. It's just, this is so hard. Why have we, why have we decided to do this? It's horrible. And then it all came together. But I think the, the, the, the idea was develop three characters who do feel like characters. They don't just feel like philosophical, you know, psychological avatars, but where one is really, really driven by ego, one is really driven by ID and one is really driven by trying to get a head. So some kind of representation of the super ego and see how that feels when they all play off against each other."

I spent over 1000 hours in the world of GTA five and GTA a online GTA four is a hard second or third. It never ceases to impress me. When you lead a team of over 1000 people to make a masterpiece like GTA five or Red Dead Redemption two, how do you ensure that the bar perfection is always met? How is that even possible? We know the answer isn't money 'cause there's other studios with a lot of money and they are two decades behind Rockstar. So what does it take to create these worlds, to create these incredibly compelling games?"

And we thought we were making something pretty innovative. I mean we, we knew we were making something innovative, but we didn't know if people would understand how innovative it was. And then when we got the chance to make, to make Vice City and to try and repeat it, I think every time from then on, the teams very driven to make something better and to use long before we had lots of resources to use time and whatever money we had to always put impressive stuff on the screen. Always think about what we can do to push the medium of video games and the sort of medium of building fake worlds further. And that was always, you know, there was a, it was a co it was, you know, both clarity of here's what we're trying to do, here's what the tone of the game is gonna be, here's how features will fit into that. And so why these features would work and these features wouldn't work. 'cause fundamentally by 2002 you could put pretty much any feature a game you wanted. It wasn't a, it wasn't a tech, there wasn't a technical limitation. It was just making it cohesive. And then it was also just everyone committing to a culture of excellence."

What compared to this, what else is there? So that's the ups and downs of life. It's, you need the darkness, you need the lows to really experience the highs. Let me ask you about the pressure. There's an insane level of excitement and expectation for grant theft 0.06. Same was true for GTA five and GTA four and even before that and you and the team delivered every time. How difficult was it to do creative work under such pressure where everyone expects this to be a success?"

Just do my best and hopefully I won't be found out this time. And just if I can be, if I can go, I tried hard with the work. I tried to do it with integrity. I tried not to copy someone else. I probably have done all of the above, you know, try to bring something new to it and we may and we as a group made something we are proud of, then that's enough. You can't, if you don't want to go insane or if I didn't want to go insane, you couldn't sit there and worry about financial results. You know, if we made something great and it didn't sell, that would have to be okay. 'cause the goal is to make something that's, you know, video games are expensive. So it is a sort of commercial form of creativity. It's a commercial art form, you know, so you have to be in long mind. You're spending large amount of someone else's money. You have to try and make it back for them. But at the same time, our, my, my argument with myself as well, if we, the way to make it back is try and make something great. So both pressures of pointing in the same direction. I think GTA four was very pressured 'cause there'd been all this pressure on the company. The company nearly imploded several times due to hot coffee. It was extremely tough. So I think that felt very stressful. GTA three, the company was basically broke, but I was young, I didn't really care. You know, it didn't, it wasn't, I wasn't living in, in, in, in the grown up world yet. All of them had their own pressure. All of the games had their own pressure. All the more I felt I'd gone into it creatively and tried to be more ambitious. For me personally, I felt more pressure, you know, when it, when it came out that, that, that would, that would've been the right choice. 'cause again, if you're trying to take big swings creatively and you've spent a lot of money, that can be quite stressful. You know, I think with, with with Red Dead too and you know, we were behind schedule, we were over budget so much. I didn't wanna think about it. And you're making a game about a cowboy dying of TB and the game's not coming together. Turns out a lot of people doubt you at that moment. You know, it's not that fun. So I think that was a lot of pressure. But all, you know, anything and if you're doing something new, you know, the new stuff, there's not necessarily pressure on releasing a comic book or in the same way 'cause it's not taking as long. But you know, if you are making things, there's always pressure that people are gonna like it."

You know, people have very strong feelings. I like this one. I didn't like that one as much. 'cause they are pretty different. So you, there would be simultaneously where you know what's gonna happen. It's a grand Theft Auto, you know, it's gonna be a game about being a criminal, but the way it's gonna be a game is gonna change quite a lot. So I think the way that the IP kept evolving meant people being really excited to play it and we were good at marketing them as well. We, we really tried to market them in a way that felt like an update of classic film marketing where you were really felt like you already in the product just 'cause you'd seen the trailers and stuff."

You know, you needed guns, you needed this larger than life characters. It, you know, it just, it just felt like it was, the game was so much about America, you know, possibly from an outsider's perspective, but you know, that that was so much about what the thing was that it wouldn't really work in the same way elsewhere."

Excited for what we're working on now. Super excited, of course, letting go of something. I've worked on it one way or another for like 20 odd years, you know, and, and, and wrote on them for the last 10 or 11 that came out. Wrote all of them, you know, lead writer and all them, whatever it was. So of course letting go of that is, you know, is a big, is a big change and, and a lot and, and, and, and sad in a way because it was, each of the games was a kind of standalone story. It's not quite the same as as I think probably it would be in some ways sadder if someone continued on Red Dead because it was a cohesive two game mark. That might be more sad to hear someone working on that. But again, not that, that will probably happen too. They're not, I don't own the ip. That was the sort of part of the, the, the deal. It's a privilege to work on stuff, but you don't necessarily own it."

It's a melancholic feeling, but there's nothing like that feeling. And you've achieved, it's so rare in video games to be able to achieve that with Red Dead. And for me it was Grand Theft Auto, A four with Nico. I had to ask about, in that 2018 interview, you talked about satirizing American culture, which I think Grand Theft Auto was trying to do. And you've made I think a really powerful observation that on the political front, people are getting more divided. It's getting more Absurd and ridiculous and extreme. So becoming harder and harder to satirize 'cause of how rapidly it's becoming ridiculous. You're talking about you don't even know if a grant Theft Auto six, if it's possible to satirize, because by the time you release the thing, it's already going to be outdated in terms of the, the satire will become reality essentially. First of all, it'd be nice to get your updated view on that. Second of all, it seems like you've answered your very own comment with American Caper, which seems to satirize American culture just fine in how much over the top it goes. Anyway, there's lots of questions in there."

So the number one success is are you making that money back plus a dollar at, at some level. That has to be, that has to be the single most important thing. So you get to do it again. You know, you've got big teams of people, people need to pay the rent, you have to keep the lights on in the business so that you have to make a small profit if you think in that way that keeps you being creative. I think that was like trying to forget about that. Not really an option, but we almost always did that. We didn't quite always do that, but we almost always did that.

I think that the cowboy setting is great because it gives a sort of mythic seriousness that sometimes doing stuff in a contemporary setting doesn't allow, you know, I think the closest we got to that kind of seriousness was GTA four, but it just can't, once you're setting things in the modern world, they're too frenetic. You can't get some of that slightly, you know, operatic feel that. I love that that that some people think is maybe a little over the top. But I, I, you know, I love this kind of, you know, people searching for meaning within, amongst the violence. I think that the, the, the West and all of the themes around the west really lend itself to that. So I think that, and then the, the gunplay was fantastic and the horses were incredible.

So Open, Open World video games were very good for my mental health in that way. Kept me busy but red. So red I'll, I'll tell, I'll give you the, my version. The games are made by big teams. Yeah. So I, I will give you my human interest version of the story. From my perspective only we, we made Red Dead Revolver decided that, or finished Red Dead Revolver, that'd been a cap con game and they didn't wanna finish it. So we finished it and they released it in Japan and we released it in the US in I think 2004 and decided we would start work on open world cowboy game for PS three. Didn't think too much more about it. And that was when we had a bunch of other stuff to work on. And slowly 2005, 2006, the game started to come to life, began to meet with the lead designer, Christian essa and thrash out a few ideas and story ideas for, for the game and begin to think about some stuff and start thinking about, well, what works in open world game, what works for a cowboy game? And again, with being lazy or procrastinating,"

And then I'll assemble. If I, if they're done digitally, then I'll do, I'll, I'll assemble them into one long word file and then I'll look at them and go, you know, here's an idea, here's an idea, here's an idea. And see if it comes to anything. See if I now aggregate them together and then read through them, I, there's anything coherent there. You know, something like a character like this, a character like that, this would be a funny line. This is a line for the main character, actually make the main character work like this, you know, or what about this relationship? As you start to just play around with what about if we start in that place, Go to that place, start, just start to play around with all of the different bits and pieces. And we began to flesh out some flow for the start of the game. And this idea you'd start in Dusty American West, which meant we didn't have to make too many trees and then Go to Mexico and then come back and we had a sort of loose flow and I was really scared of writing any actual dialogue and I didn't have a clue how to go about it. And I, it'll come, it'll come. And then, and I kept, I could postpone if ages were doing GTA four and I kept worrying about it. And then gt my work was wrapped on four, but the game wasn't now yet. And we've done a bunch of the marketing stuff and I had a little window when I wasn't doing much else. And I took a week with my then girlfriend, now wife, who was heavily pregnant with our first child. And we went up to a house upstate and sat there in the, well she, she, she sat there either cooking for me or watching TV or eating. And I went and sat in the room all day, every day and just sat there and stared at the computer and tried to think about how can I do this that, it doesn't sound ridiculous. How can you write in, in, in a, in a cowboy idiom that feels both slightly contemporary but also gives the game this sort of life and this weight that I want it to have and think we can think we can get away with. And after about three days it just started to come and then suddenly I wrote about nine, 10 scenes in the next couple of days. And after I knew I had it and it was, dunno if it was, that was why there was so much about a character caring about his family because I was just beginning the process of having a family."

He does all the, John does all the dirty work of hunting down his old gang and he finally is able to go home and be with his family, be on the ranch and then the government betrays him and sends troops to, to kill him. And, and there is dialogue. I mean that is just, I think the two times I shed a tear in video game history for me is that dialogue. I think John talking to his wife, if I vaguely remember, I think he said, I love you, but he said very li he didn't, he made it seem like he's going to see her and his son shortly. That dialogue was massively done. Like a definition of like less is more. It was just so crisp. That, and of course the other one is again from memory, Arthur riding his horse and the music is playing. It's very hard not to shatter a tear during that. Anyway, the dialogue of John talking to his wife at, at the end when he's in a barn and he is about to walk out to face certain death. Do you remember writing that?"

But for a game to work, it felt like a challenge to make him die. It was probably the four fifth or sixth open world game I'd worked on. And I'd, you know, spent all these years before that working out how these stories worked, how to make them work technically, how to make them feel right. How they interacted with the open form gameplay as best I could. And suddenly we're gonna break one of our golden rules, which was at the end of the game, you are free in the character to go and wrap up all the side stories to play forever. We're not gonna, you're not gonna be able to do that in this game 'cause the guy's gonna be dead and we're gonna have to have you play as a different character. And the the narrative is, is gonna be if we've done a good job compelling enough where you're not gonna care about that and or you're gonna be upset that he's dead, but you're gonna actually have this emotional moment. So I think it was a big risk from a technical perspective for us to do that. And then it worked. So I think that was something that was very full of fear and it put, and it worked, it worked out okay and think people were really upset and angry at us for doing it because I think it was gonna happen. But I think they also had that kind of experience you are describing. It was that kind of creative moment where, you know, transcendent moment with, with characters in a piece of fiction, which is what we've always aspired to giving people."

So to me, I think definitively Arthur from Red Dead Redemption Two is the best character ever created in video games ever. I, I think there's not even clo I mean John will be the second, which is hilarious to say, but like tho those are, John will be a close second. But Arthur is definitively, and you, you've talked about, and in that interview you said that a lot of video games work on the same premise that you start as a weak person and end up as a strong superhero. But what if you start as a tough guy, someone who already is very strong, someone that's emotionally confident of his place in the world. Arthur's journey is not about becoming a superhero because he's almost one at the start, but it's about an intellectual rollercoaster when his worldview gets taken apart. So it's, it's, it's very different than the normal journey of a character."

And so the idea that it's John's death is fairly sudden. And so if he's got this long drawn out death, and then I'd always been obsessed by TB as diseases go, it's a great literary device, you know, 'cause it is this long drawn out slow death, but in which you are also getting weaker. And my grandfather actually had TB before they invented antibiotics and was sent to a sanatorium just after he was, just after he'd had his child, my father and survived. But only three of them out of like 35 survived. So I was always captivated and, and by TB as an illness, it felt like it was an interesting thing to play around with as an idea. This, this guy getting weaker who felt like he was immortal and essentially was immortal. He was the protagonist in a video game. He could not die and suddenly he's becoming mortal and, and you know, but that helps him see stuff. I thought that was a different way of doing a, a lead character in a game."

So the biggest, most important question, primary central to the reason we're talking today, the number one question from the internet, it is so ridiculous. But I must asked, have you seen Gavin? Who is Gavin? So for more context, there's a guy named Nigel in Red Dead Redemption two who's frantically searching for a mystery man named Gavin throughout the game. This has become one of the biggest mysteries amongst the interwebs, the RDR fan base. So the theories include theory one is it's a split personality disorder. Nigel himself is Gavin. So the evidence is the letter for this theory that has some evidence that may be due to trauma. The Split personality disorder was created, this Gavin was created inside Nigel's mind. Theory two is Gavin is dead and Nigel is simply in denial. Theory three is that it's just a troll and Rockstar intentionally created an unsolvable mystery to drive players crazy. I also heard theory four is Gavin is the strange man. So there's this fascinating character, the Strange Man, this supernatural character that has a presence in RDR one and a little bit in RDR two also. Yeah. So, which, which theory is closest to the truth?"

You wanted it to have a little bit of adventure to it, but it was meant to be, without ever fully being explained that Gavin's not there anymore.

We made Red Dead one and we, well we're making Red Dead one and we'd made this, we felt quite compelling story and quite interesting open world. But, and we would, we'd already made a bunch of grand Theft Auto obviously, but unfortunately we'd taken out the machine guns 'cause it was a cowboy game apart from the big fixed position ones. And we'd taken out the cars and we'd taken out the city and large numbers of pedestrians. So we essentially had a game about a dude riding a horse around the desert. And it was quite, and it was quite boring. And so we were, we then started filling it with content and we filled it with these and having to improvise and we filled it with these things we call random events that would be they sort of mocap moments that you could interact with. And it was, they, they were, they were, the designers did an amazing job at those. They were really fun, but there was not enough of them. And then we felt we needed more story 'cause the story was perhaps a little short. So we kind of quite late in development started putting in almost like these RPG type content where you go and meet someone. And the way we thought of them was they were like short stories. So you go and meet someone, they'd set you a slow problem like go and collect me 15 bunches of flowers and when you came, came back it would resolve your story. And so one, go, go and get them for my bride. And you come back and the bride's dead. You know, there was always tried to make them like these short stories with a sting in the tail. And he came out as I was trying to come up with ideas for those as just this weird character. And then we built him a bit into the story where he would unlock as you worked your way through and be a commentary on what you were doing. So he was meant to be a kind of manifestation of your, you know, shadow, your karma, the devil somewhere, you know, just saw the world. And then we built out his backstory over time and decide, you know, and so in Red Dead too, you could interact with him again and or not really interact with him, but he was there and he was meant to be, you know, something, I suppose any creative is scared of an artist who'd kind of sold his soul to the devil. And that slowly revealed itself."

So it felt it was still valid video game content. 'cause it was living up to a point. And I just thought the character Dr. Freelander was just funny 'cause he was awful. So it was like LA you are in therapy, it's very LA but he's also very la he wants to write a book and betray you. Yeah. Which felt like a good, a good twist. And it was, he felt like a grand Theft Auto therapist. But just like the idea of making the player in a game and games are intrinsically kind of physical and you know, you, you walk, you, you punch things, you run around, you drive cars, you shoot people, whatever.

You know, I think there was always, there was a bit at the start of RDR where he'd had a baby who just died in Red Dead two and we ended up cutting it, which was the right decision. It was too tough in some ways, but I think it gave him real and he was not very sympathetic to his occasional girlfriend who'd had the baby. And so it made him very, very nasty at the start, which I thought would be interesting to play around with. 'cause then it would make his redemptive arc even more interesting. Like he was not a likable character at the start. And that was one. And we ended up making slightly more. Like he's still sort of tough and nasty, but he's slightly more likable. Early on that was the right decision. Commercially, it's better that way. But I don, you know, but I still, I, I like that little bit. It spoke to me personally there and, and just his, his in inability to access his emotions, I thought was really strong. 'cause then later in the games get very emotional, but there's also always little bits and pieces that get trimmed, you know, and, and, and don't, well missions that just are not gonna work technically. Usually it's like, this mission's not gonna work technically. Oh God, we've gotta cut it. Okay, how do we glue the story back together? And we got better over time at gluing the story across missing chunks. You get late in the game and it's just something, you know, some big challenging moment just is gonna look rubbish. So you just get rid of it."

So it was always, there's always compromises, but it was, you know, I, I like making the stories for me, I love the model of GTA four when you had the extra stories coming afterwards, all Red Dead one when you had the zombie pack coming afterwards. I like just doing these extra things. So I would, I would, I personally like to have done more of that in that company. And with stuff we're doing in the future, we're gonna try and come up with worlds where we can add more stories. I like single player DLCI just think the audience loves it and it's really fun to make."

And, and also a lot of like cynical looking at looking at what goes well in the industry. Luckily if you want to do what we are forced to do and also what I want to do, which is make new ip, you need single player games. You can launch a a multiplayer game as a, as a a with new ip. It's just extremely hard. So luckily we are like focusing on what we're good at, which is open world, single player games. And we might add multiplayer components to one of them. I think one of them, it's gonna be really tough later on, but we're still thinking that through. But I think we are really leaning into single player experience as being a strength for us as a company and something we love to do. And I think something a large part of the audience prefers, and I'd love to with all of those keep single player DLC one way or another going."

We do the early work as you get the world up and running. It never, it never really found its feet in either of the That's so interesting. And I sort of think I know why because one of those films, they're very, very frenetic and they beat to beat, to beat. You know, you've gotta go here and save the world. You gotta go there and stop that person being killed and then save the world. And an open world game does have moments like that when the story comes together. But for large portions it's a lot kind of looser and you're just hanging out and you're just doing what you want. And I want freedom and I wanna go over here and do what I want and I wanna go over and do what you want. And that's why it works well being a criminal because you fundamentally have anyone telling you what to do. And we try and create, you know, external agency through these people kind of forcing you into the story at times. But as a spy, that doesn't really work because you have to be against the clock. So I think for me, I'm, I question if you can even make a good open world spy game."

And I bought a notebook and I'd occasionally scribble in it. And I still got those notebooks somewhere. And I was working in video games, which were the least literary medium it's possible to imagine. At the time. There was no room for that on PS one games, really thinking I needed to stop and do something else, but not having the skills or the confidence to do it. And I'd been doing that in London, then I came to New York and it was fun, really fun to be in New York and really fun to do a new company in New York. And that was an amazing adventure. But I was still lost as a human being. And then when I was 27, I was still completely lost a child and I stopped some of my bad behavior and the next day, pretty much the chance to write on network work at Oakwell games and all the skills I'd half learnt over the previous years. And my way of thinking where I thought about space a lot because I was a geographer rather than a historian came together and I got the chance to work on more games. It felt like it was meant to be. It was fun to explore, but really fun to explore with this team that was, you know, Alex Horton and Na and Leslie and the guys in Scotland and all the people in, in New York making these new games in this new way and, and going, oh, we need to find a hundred voices where we've got no money. How the hell are we gonna do that? We'll get everyone's friends in and just record dial more lines of dialogue each as we kind of would invent the way that pedestrians were speaking video games. No one else was doing that kind of stuff. It was insane. So I think that period from kind of 2001, 2005, it was lots of early innovation and, and felt really exciting because we were doing new stuff. It didn't feel it, it felt creative, but it didn't feel like writing yet, just becoming that. It felt lots of doing lots of creative things and learning how to assemble the stuff and learning what it could take. And then, I think we talked about it earlier, but the, the journey into doing GTA four when it began to feel more like a proper writing experience. And I was kind of probably ready for that at that point. And then I was like, well, this is better than films. This is something that films can't do. You know, this 360 degree experience of being this immigrant. And it still felt that we were still only scratching the surface. I mean, it still feels like that now in some ways, but it still felt, and then that five games, you know, GTA four and five, red Dead One and two, all the extra packs for them and Max Pain three, I think we took the games thematically into new places through that period. From a writing perspective, that was the most exciting period from a, from a business and, and, and sort of early creativity period. The period 2001, 2005 was probably the most exciting. The original starting team. We were all doing, well, you know, personal life was doing okay, didn't feel like such a mess. And then, and then from 2007 onwards, seven eight was happy, personally having children happily married and the games were just getting much better. But there were lots of pressure in the business, you know, it was just we, and the budgets got really big, so I had this other stress. So there's always, always good bits and stresses, but, you know, and always just tried to sharp and do my best and, and think about how I could do it in a new way. Always trying to go, it's a new medium, what can we do that's new?"

But that began in 2001. Yeah. And we, the, the office at, at Rockstar was so small and we were so broke that there was no, and I, I did have a private office at the time, but it genuinely was a cupboard. It didn't have a window. I was literally sitting in a cupboard, so there was no room. And I could had a desk and a chair just for myself. So we, but I lived quite near the office. So we would write one or two afternoons a week. He'd come in, he was a freelancer working with us. He'd come in from Long Island and then we would jump on the subway, Go to my apartment in Chelsea and sit in this grimy little apartment I was living in and buy pizza from around the corner. And that became, and you know, we both liked Diet Coke and pizza, very video game developer. And that became good luck. And we'd have these good writing sessions where we realized we got on well with each other and that we had a similar sense of humor and we could write the stuff and then he would do all of the real work producing it. So it was perfect for me because I gotta outsource most of the real work. And he's a brilliant radio producer. So he was a great partner in that way. And then that was how that relationship began. And then I'd get him, I would say, well, we've got to record these 80 voices, come and help me. 'cause I can't direct 80 people at once. So he would help with that process. And he was a really good producer, like audio, like getting bodies in producer as well as a technical producer. So he was just a, that was the beginning of that relationship. And it was always my job was to ensure the media content felt like it reflected the tone of the world and we would write it together. Then his job was just to make sure it sounded funny. Like he would just produce it in a really funny way."

It's, it, it's quite systemic, but it's so how it all glues together is so amazing. It feels like when you watch a Hitchcock film, it's not reality. He's speaking the language of cinema in a very, very strong, without a very strong accent almost. It's very, very cinematic. It's not realism at all.

I in the same with the new, with the new games, we're constantly trying to find the balance between, you know, RPG of role playing game and an action game and an, you know, and try go, well, an action adventure game with RPG elements and what does that mean? And I think they've all kind of moved into roughly the same space. But for me it always just comes down to our, is it easy to play? Oh, our mechanics super slick. And then can we keep our dialogue feeling very alive? Like I'm not always a great for just for what we do. I like when other people do it for what we do. We always want very punchy dialogue, so don't give big trees, but still have it interactive. So we're gonna, we're gonna lose a touch of interactivity, but we'll still have the dialogue feeling like it's alive, but we'll get better written dialogue and it feel more, a slightly more cinematic experience."

I think if you are trying to do, you know, good stuff and you are reflective inevitably and, and, you know, you live in this world of constant, constant criticisms by the internet. Of course, you know, everyone who ever puts something on the internet, be it a picture of themselves or any kind of work they've made or whatever it is, is gonna get 50 good comments and one bad comment, remember the bad comment. So that, and that, that becomes fuel for the negative voice. I dunno anyone that's strong enough not to, you know, we all, you know, some level you should just measure stuff that stuff in, in weight, not in, not in quality, but of course we just focus on the quality."

I think the heroic action to take with time is to become more optimistic, to see more good, to, I think that there's probably a hero's journey of being extremely self-critical at first for, for the, the, the, the first maybe half of your life or two third.

And I should also give a shout out to an excellent podcast you do with Sonya Walger, who's a friend of yours, but she had a great podcast. She has guests picked their five favorite most impactful books and so on. You picked five fiction books, one for each decade of your life. For the audience, they should go listen to that conversation. But you picked Winter Holiday by Arthur Ransom. Second one was Withering Heights by Emily Bronte, then tenders the Night by F Scott Fitzgerald, the Thin Red Line by James Jones and Middle March by George Elliott. But just zooming out, reflecting back on that conversation, what do you think if an alien came, what are, what are some candidates for books that you'll recommend to them?"

And, and, and they're both, both that kind of, it's something I was always trying to put into games and, and you know, that feeling of all of life is here. Hmm. You know, you've got love, death, violence, romance, the whole human experience in different ways. So I think that that there's something amazing about, you know, vanity Fair.

So there's a whole, and everyone's scared of being killed by Stalin 'cause it's Post the Purges. But then you get these guys and they're trapped in a building, fighting in Stalingrad. And so they know at this moment they're dead anyway. And they get to live like pure perfect Marxist communists Away from Staling Rule is nonsense. And I thought that section's incredible. 'cause you realize, like in some ways, in all of its horrors, the most disappointing thing about the 20th century in some ways was the absolute failure of communism. You know, it was because it was such a, you know, quote unquote beautiful idea. And it just did not work time and time again. And these people who fought for it and then saw it not working, I think they're sort of fascinating characters. Yeah.

I ran away from the guy with a knife. That was a good decision. Yeah. I came to America. That was a good decision. I ran, came to LA That's, I think, been a good decision. It's been fun to see a different side of America and being a different creative environment. LA is still amazing for creativity and entertainment, the wider entertainment industry stuff. I think that's been fun. What would I say? I would say when you get a chance, take it. That was one thing I did do well at. When I got got chances, I was good at taking them. I would say, do not worry too young about your career. I would say worry about having a rounded intellectual inner life. 'cause you're gonna spend the whole of your life in your own head. So the more interesting you find your own head, the more interesting you find the world, the less you are gonna annoy yourself. So I would say I would, I would say do not do a vocational degree as an undergraduate. That's been my, I would say do something else. Do something, you know, random and then focus afterwards. That would be, I think I, I was advocating against the obsession that people had about four years ago with STEM subjects and now AI's gonna make 'em all irrelevant anyway perhaps. So, you know, I, it's interesting to see everything changes. Jobs are not that hard. You know, turn up, be enthusiastic, be turn, turn up in, in person, be enthusiastic. Help people say you'll be finding in any job people, you know."

Age 25. My latest poor choice was to get up too early. 'cause the police didn't start work till nine. But the mugger started at eight. And so I was out walking along the beach at eight and these guys, this raster turned up who I'd been talking to the day before, trying to talk to me. And then two guys came up to talk to him and I couldn't tell if they were trying to mug him 'cause he owed them money or he'd bought me to them. But I did notice one of them had a machete and now they had a kind of broken gun. So I thought this is not good. And I ran off sprinted down the beach in my, in my silly shoes and got to the chance once in my life to run over to a road run, jump into a taxi and scream, you know, take me anywhere. I feel like I'm an action movie. And there guys chasing after the machete and the taxi driver looks back, sees the dude with the machete and goes, see Amigos and I, they're not my friends. Get me outta here. And then I, he drove me up the street into a, the town was, it was kind of between the old town and the new town in Cartia. And I got out of the car and then cut my foot on a rock that was the sum total of my injuries. And then went to an internet cafe, 'cause this was probably late 98. And got the chance to come and work on a game for six weeks in New York. And I was like, well if I stay in South America much longer, I'm gonna get myself killed. 'cause this was, I was getting into silly stuff. And so I went to New York and they're just starting Rockstar. And so I got to sort of write the mission statements and, and whatnot there and, and help set the tone for that. And just ended up staying, you know, had to come and go a bit. Well, well Visas got sorted out and then just ended up staying for ah, stay for a year. 'cause New York's pretty fun. They actually was not that, this was the height of Giuliani before he was a maniac. So he, you couldn't, when you went to bars you were told you couldn't dance. 'cause they were trying to clamp down on New York being fun. So it was actually less fun than London. But there's still a great energy in New York and got exposed to the kind of madness of New York capitalism,"

But I just look at it and see problems and see things that we can make do better. You know, I think it was always try each time do it better. And I've got, you know, some of the stuff we're working on now is gonna do stuff that people haven't really seen before. And I think it's just, I think the games can get so much better. They can feel so much more alive. All the, they can be better at storytelling and feel more alive and feel like, you know, their systems. All the stuff, the, the component parts we talked about. You can, we can both make each of those parts better and tie 'em together better. I think it's the technology, it's all, to me it still feels like it's only just beginning. You know, it's been, it's been cinema evolved from like 1900, 18 95 whenever it was until they invented talking in 1930 or whenever that was. It's not that. And then it's kind of found its modern form and then by 39 they're shooting in color and that's basically a modern film is no different from a 1939 film. But with games I still think we've got a long way to go. The tech, there's so many different parts of the tech that it's still got a long way to go and you can go in all different fun directions."
